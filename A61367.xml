            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Reverend FATHER in GOD, NICOLAS LORD BISHOP OF <hi>CHESTER.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT was my <hi>early</hi> and <hi>great</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that I was <hi>then</hi> a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of <hi>Trinity-College, when</hi> You were an Eminent <hi>Guide</hi> to the Studies of the <hi>Youth</hi> there. For, tho'
<pb facs="tcp:49679:3"/>You were not my appointed Tutor; yet it ſo fell out, that for Two Years together (a Thing perhaps ſcarce known in the College, but at that Time) the great and daily Burden of the Philoſophy-Lecture was laid upon <hi>You:</hi> And (for which I do to this Day bleſs the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) thoſe Two Years fell in with that Time, in which <hi>my</hi> Standing in the Houſe obliged me to attend thoſe <hi>Lectures.</hi> And, whatever other Influence they had on me; This I can with Truth avow, That from <hi>that</hi> Time I always carried in my Breaſt an <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> for Your <hi>Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I therefore tell Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe (I believe) You could not have known it without my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. For, the beneficial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of very uſeful Men diffuſes it ſelf farther, than their own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation reaches: And ſome Few
<pb facs="tcp:49679:3"/>
                     <hi>chuſe</hi> that it <hi>ſhould</hi> do ſo. And I am not ſo much a Stranger to <hi>Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> as not to know, that <hi>You</hi> have a chief Place <hi>among</hi> thoſe Few. But then withal, I beg leave to add, That tho' it be a Noble Temper in Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to <hi>overlook</hi> Your Good Deeds to <hi>others;</hi> yet that will not <hi>excuſe</hi> thoſe others, if <hi>they</hi> ſhould do ſo too: For, Ingratitude is not the <hi>leſs,</hi> but the <hi>more</hi> Criminal, where there is no Expectation of <hi>Requital.</hi> For which Reaſon, I have rather adventured to treſpaſs upon Your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Goodneſs, than to forfeit all Title to Goodneſs <hi>my ſelf,</hi> by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to You ſome of thoſe Fruits, which do very much owe themſelves to Your early Watering and Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation.</p>
                  <p>But tho' theſe Your <hi>early</hi> Benefits were (I believe) unknown to Your Self; yet I am ſure, that ſome <hi>later</hi> ones are not: Tho' withal I know,
<pb facs="tcp:49679:4"/>that You would have them be ſo to <hi>others.</hi> You cannot but remember, (I am ſure, I cannot) how affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately You did <hi>deſire</hi> my advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Settlement in this City, and how zealouſly You did <hi>proſecute</hi> ſuch Your Deſire both with Your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Aſſiduity, till You made it appear, that You did <hi>more</hi> than barely deſire it. And I own it to the World, that my Firſt Preferment in <hi>London</hi> I obtained by Your Means.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Your Kindneſſes You ſtill purſued with a condeſcending Friendſhip, by which I was bleſſed with the Freedom and Benefit of Your Converſation, that is, with an Advantageous <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> in my <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and with an Advantageous <hi>Example</hi> of a ſincere <hi>Piety.</hi> The Faults therefore of what I here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Your Lordſhip and the World, I do with Shame take to my ſelf:
<pb facs="tcp:49679:4"/>For, they might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, had I carefully followed my Copy.</p>
                  <p>But there ſeems to be a Fatality in Humane Frailty; and therefore Imitations always fall ſhort of their Originals. But ſtill I reverence what I cannot tranſcribe; and ſo will every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who knows Your Lordſhip, and loves our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in ſincerity. For, a good Part of the Nation can bear You witneſs, that You have with an hearty Affection, and with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Diligence, imployed Your ſelf in that Work (of which he is the Maſter-Builder) that is, of building up <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their moſt Holy Faith, and of edifying them to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. May His Grace make Your Succeſs equal to Your Labours; and may Your Example provoke other His Meſſengers to an Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Your Practices. His exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:49679:5"/>You to ſuch a Station, where Your Example is more viſible, and its Influence more powerful, adds Faith to ſuch my Wiſhes; and Your great Candor and Integrity (which are Inſinuating and Victorious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) do increaſe ſuch my Faith. For, I do confeſs, I have my ſelf felt Your Influence; and becauſe we are apt to judge other Men by our ſelves, I can the more eaſily believe, that others may do ſo too. God grant, that they may do ſo without my Defects; of which ſo many <hi>Inſtances</hi> as the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe may offer to the <hi>Severity</hi> of Your <hi>Judgment,</hi> ſo many freſh <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> it will alſo afford for the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> of Your <hi>Candor:</hi> For, what the <hi>Firſt</hi> may <hi>condemn,</hi> the <hi>Laſt</hi> may <hi>pardon;</hi> and tho' You do not <hi>allow</hi> my <hi>Performance,</hi> yet You may <hi>accept</hi> my <hi>Endeavours.</hi> However, I deſire You to believe, that what I here offer to Your Lordſhip is deſigned
<pb facs="tcp:49679:5"/>as a Publick Teſtimony of that great Reverence I have for Your Perſon, Piety, and Learning; and of thoſe Acknowledgments which are due for Your great and paſt Favours to,</p>

                  <head>TO THE READERS.</head>
                  <p>BEfore I enter upon the Diſcourſe it ſelf, I have ſomething to offer to Two ſorts of Readers. Firſt, To thoſe who deny the Doctrine propoſed: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To thoſe who own it.</p>
                  <p>They of the Firſt ſort, to whom I ſhall addreſs my ſelf, are either the <hi>Sober</hi> and the <hi>Serious,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Vicious</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Firſt of theſe, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate our Saviour's Perſon, and deny his Purchaſe, do undertake to do ſo from Grounds of Natural <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For, tho' they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to acknowledge <hi>Revelation</hi> in the Caſe,
<pb facs="tcp:49679:7"/>yet that is but a Pretence; becauſe it is notorious, that they will not allow ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to ſpeak its <hi>own</hi> Senſe, where it does not ſpeak <hi>theirs.</hi> For, they do ſo far make their Natural Reaſon the Meaſure of Divine Truth, as to believe no ſuch Truth any farther than it falls in with ſuch their Reaſon: And ſo the Revelation comes to be believed, not becauſe it is acknowledged to be <hi>Divine,</hi> but only becauſe it <hi>conforms</hi> to ſuch their Meaſure. And therefore, where their Meaſure falls ſhort, there the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' it do expreſly diſſent from them, ſhall yet, by one Artifice or other, be brought down to comply with it.</p>
                  <p>And to make what I ſay appear true, I ſhall here offer Two Inſtances of ſuch their Practice, and that too in Two Things which do very much concern our future Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which are, Death, and a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, tho' we know by our <hi>Natural</hi> Reaſon, that Sin <hi>deſerves</hi> Puniſhment; yet
<pb facs="tcp:49679:7"/>we know only by <hi>Revelation,</hi> that <hi>Death</hi> is a Puniſhment of Sin. And therefore the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who in this Caſe had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to inſtruct them, had no other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Death, but that it was neceſſary and natural. And <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers have expreſly told us, (and that too in ſpite of Revelation) That their Notion of it is juſt the ſame. They tell us indeed moreover, That tho' Death be natural, yet had Man continued Innocent, God would have over-ruled Nature, and ſo have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from Death. That is, the Holy and Wiſe God had by the ordinary and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Frame of Things expoſed his Innocent Creature to the greateſt Natural Miſchief: But then, that ſuch a Diſpoſition of Things might not caſt a Blemiſh upon his Juſtice, he prevented the Effect of it by his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence: In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he had ordered Things ſo, that had not his Omnipotence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, the Conſequence of ſuch Order had been Injuſtice. A very honourable Account of God's Juſtice and Wiſdom in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which is ſo far from mending the
<pb facs="tcp:49679:8"/>Matter, that it makes it worſe. But what better is to be expected, when Man ſhall by his Natural Reaſon preſume to controul the Revelations of God?</p>
                  <p>Their Reaſon then having faultred in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Account of the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of Sin; it may upon that ſcore the more eaſily do ſo, in giving us an Account of the <hi>Pardon</hi> of it. For, beſides that a Reſurrection, which is a Releaſe from Death, the Puniſhment of Sin, is only made known by Revelation; and therefore they, who ſay, that Death is Natural, muſt (if they will agree with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) diſagree from the Scriptures, and ſay, That a Reſurrection is a Releaſe from a <hi>Miſchief,</hi> which is <hi>Natural;</hi> but not that it is ſo from a <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> which is <hi>Moral:</hi> But, I ſay, beſides this; when they come by their Reaſon to tell us, <hi>how</hi> a Releaſe from Death comes to be granted; they will not, with the Scriptures, allow ſuch Releaſe to be granted in Conſideration of our <hi>Saviour's Merits;</hi> but will by all Means aſcribe it to God's <hi>more</hi> Mercy. Now tho'
<pb facs="tcp:49679:8"/>it be allowed, that the Pardon of Sin comes from God's Mercy; and that ſuch his Mercy, as it relates to us, is Free, becauſe we can in no wiſe deſerve it; yet, for all that, ſuch Mercy is not in it ſelf, what they would have it to be, the Effect of God's Free-will alone.</p>
                  <p>For, God's Mercy, as his <hi>Word,</hi> (which can beſt inform us in the Caſe) and as <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſound Reaſon,</hi> agreeing with ſuch his Word, will tell us, is of Two ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His Mercy is in the Scriptures taken for his Bounty; and from this it is that all his Creatures derive all they are, and all they have: And this his Mercy conſiſts in <hi>giving.</hi> But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His Mercy is taken for the Pardon of ſinful Man; and this his Mercy conſiſts in <hi>forgiving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much Difference then, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Giving and Forgiving; ſo much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb facs="tcp:49679:9"/>there is between the Firſt Mercy, and the Second.</p>
                  <p>Now, by the Firſt Mercy God may (it is confeſſed give freely, and in what Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he pleaſes: For, he may do what he will with his own, and that according to the unbounded Liberty of his own good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; which is therefore evident, becauſe he may place a Creature in what Station, and beſtow upon it what Endowments and what Happineſs he pleaſes, ſo far as a Creature, as ſuch, is capable of either. And in this Senſe all Creatures have been Partakers of his Mercy.</p>
                  <p>But that cannot be truly ſaid of that his Mercy, which conſiſts in Forgiving. For, all thoſe Creatures <hi>cannot</hi> be forgiven, who have <hi>not</hi> ſinned; and all thoſe <hi>ſhall</hi> not, that <hi>have.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' therefore the <hi>Firſt</hi> ſort of Mercy be <hi>not</hi> bounded or limited by <hi>God's Juſtice;</hi> yet the <hi>Laſt</hi> is: And therefore a <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49679:9"/>being a Forgiveneſs, <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo limited and bounded too. For, Vindictive Juſtice is not (as it is but too commonly taken to be, and as will appear more fully in the Diſcourſe it ſelf) only a Negative Juſtice; that is, it is not barely not unjuſt to puniſh a Criminal: But it is and muſt be a Poſitive Juſtice; that is, it is unjuſt not to puniſh him: Or otherwiſe, he, who has a juſt Power of puniſhing a Criminal, may, upon no other Motive, but his own Will and Pleaſure, not do it.</p>
                  <p>To tell us therefore, That God by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection grants a Releaſe from Death, the Puniſhment of Sin, only upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his mere Mercy, and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came into the World only to bring the joyful Tydings, and to ratifie the Truth of ſuch his Meſſage by his Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but that he had nothing to do in the Purchaſe of ſuch Releaſe; as it does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found God's <hi>Bounty</hi> with his <hi>Pardoning</hi> Mercy, (and ſo is a Deviation from Right <hi>Reaſon</hi>) ſo it goes counter to the expreſs
<pb facs="tcp:49679:10"/>Declarations of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and ſo is a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to Revelation.</p>
                  <p>Now the Deſign of what we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto offered, is, to engage the Men, to whom our preſent Addreſs is directed, to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether it be not more rational, to acquieſce in the plain Diſcoveries, which are made to us by Revelation, concerning the Puniſhment and Pardon of Sin, than to frame ſuch (as they call them, rational) Surmiſes of their own concerning either, which do very much differ from, and in ſome Caſes contradict ſuch plain Diſcoveries?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I would deſire them likewiſe ſeriouſly to conſider, Whether what they call Reaſon, can poſſibly have ſuch a large Proſpect, and comprehenſive Knowledge, as to be a competent Judge of the Congruity of all ſuch Things, which may poſſibly be diſcovered by Divine Revelation? For, if it <hi>have,</hi> then it muſt be no <hi>longer</hi> called Reaſon, but
<pb facs="tcp:49679:10"/>Omniſcience: And if it have <hi>not,</hi> then it will be an intolerable <hi>Preſumption</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to <hi>controul</hi> expreſs and acknowledged Revelation by it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I would deſire them to conſider, in the Third place, Whether they have by their Reaſon examined the Juſtice of the Divine Proceedings in the Pardon of Sin (as it is expreſly laid down in the Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) as <hi>far</hi> as Reaſon will go? For, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a Thing capable both of Information and Improvement: And That may not ſeem rational to a <hi>leſs</hi> careful View, which yet may do ſo to a more <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>critical</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. And therefore ſuch Plauſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall ſometimes paſs for Truths with what at <hi>preſent</hi> is thought Reaſon, which, when <hi>throughly</hi> ſifted, ſhall be found to be groſs Falſities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, I would deſire them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That God in his Revelations concerning Man's Salvation, has not only acquainted us, <hi>that</hi> he will ſave Mankind; but has alſo
<pb facs="tcp:49679:11"/>told us, upon what <hi>Conſiderations</hi> he will do ſo. For, if they be once ſatisfied, that he has revealed the <hi>Laſt,</hi> as well as the <hi>Firſt,</hi> (and by believing the plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Revelation, they may be ſo ſatisfied) then they may as reaſonably expect to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without their own <hi>Repentance,</hi> as they may without their Saviour's <hi>Merits;</hi> that is, they may be ſatisfied, that they cannot be ſaved without both.</p>
                  <p>And when they have well weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered theſe Things, it may be hoped, that being already ſuppoſed ſober and ſerious, they will alſo be found ſo modeſt, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit God to ſave them in his own Way.</p>
                  <p>The next ſort of Readers, who, as is ſuppoſed, may deny the Doctrine delivered, are the Vicious and Profane. For, they who profeſſedly renounce <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in their <hi>Practice,</hi> are eaſily brought over to renounce it in their <hi>Belief:</hi> Becauſe it is hard to conceive, that they will allow Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be <hi>his</hi> Purchaſe, and at <hi>his</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
<pb facs="tcp:49679:11"/>who has avowedly declared, that ſuch as <hi>themſelves</hi> ſhall not be made Partakers of it. And therefore, where profligate <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> does abound, it is the leſs to be wondred, tho' it be the more to be lamented, that <hi>Infidelity</hi> does ſo too. Irreligious Practices do naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Irreligious Opinions: And a plauſible Cavil againſt any material Truth in Religion, is by too many thought a ſufficient Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a profligate Life.</p>
                  <p>Now it is notorious at firſt View, that ſuch Men as theſe do therefore refuſe to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Revealed,</hi> becauſe they have firſt <hi>broke</hi> through the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Natural</hi> Religion; and that having <hi>forſaken</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> they do therefore <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> his <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Whether they have not been aſſiſted and encouraged ſo to do, by the Zeal and Abilities of thoſe, whom we have treated as the Sober and the Serious, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to conſider; as it does alſo, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Attempts to depreciate Revealed Religion, has not proved a great Occaſion
<pb facs="tcp:49679:12"/>of thoſe Immoralities, which have over-run the Nation, and which equally contradict both Revealed and Natural Religion too. For, it will be found true, that as <hi>Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> does incline Men to contemn God's <hi>Revelations,</hi> ſo a <hi>Contempt</hi> of ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> does (and that too in its own Nature) lead Men into <hi>Immorality:</hi> For, both are indeed a Contempt of God's Word. And I muſt leave it a Doubt, which of the Two mocks God moſt, whether he, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to believe a God, but yet will not obey his Word; or he, who pretends to believe Revelation, but yet will not allow ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to acquaint him with any Thing, but what his Reaſon can comprehend. The <hi>firſt</hi> puts a Slight upon his <hi>Authority;</hi> the <hi>laſt,</hi> upon his <hi>Omniſcience;</hi> but <hi>both,</hi> upon his <hi>Honour:</hi> And then we may be ſure, that both are pernicious to the Welfare of Mens Souls.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, for theſe Reaſons chiefly I have engaged my ſelf in the preſent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, it is a very melancholy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb facs="tcp:49679:12"/>to conſider, how many Men in the preſent Age, who yet call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> do profeſſedly renounce that very Faith, into which they were baptized, and that too by their Saviour's expreſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, exhibited to us in Revelation. And he muſt ſhut his Eyes, who does not take notice, that the <hi>Manners</hi> of the Age are no better than its <hi>Faith.</hi> And in ſuch a Caſe, I cannot but think it Treachery in a Miniſter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not to interpoſe in <hi>one</hi> way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or <hi>other.</hi> For, not to do it <hi>at all,</hi> is in effect to betray his <hi>Maſter,</hi> to betray his <hi>Truſt,</hi> and to betray the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men.</p>
                  <p>The other ſort of Readers, whom I would beſpeak, and that only in a Word or two, are Thoſe, who tho' they agree with me in the main and principal Concluſions, may yet perhaps differ from me in ſome ſubordinate Propoſitions, which I lay down in my Way to ſuch Concluſions. Now, to ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders I have this ſmall Requeſt, That they would not think, becauſe I hold the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:49679:13"/>
                     <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> with them, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſtand bound to take them by the ſame <hi>Philoſophical Handle.</hi> I believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, becauſe I take it to be the Word of God; I believe an Article of Faith, becauſe it is in the Scripture: But when I come to accommodate ſuch Article to Right Reaſon, I do no more think <hi>my ſelf</hi> tied up to <hi>other</hi> Mens Meaſures, than I think, that <hi>they</hi> are to be tied up to <hi>mine.</hi> We may go different Ways, and yet meet in the ſame Truth: And, which is more, perhaps the Divine Wiſdom may make uſe of ſuch our Differences to take in <hi>more</hi> Souls, <hi>whoſe</hi> Conceptions of Things do ſo differ, as <hi>ours</hi> do. And tho' I can ſay nothing for my <hi>Skill,</hi> yet I can ſay thus much for my <hi>Sincerity,</hi> that I have in all Caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever followed That, which at preſent I take to be Truth.</p>
                  <p>One Thing more I have to add, and that is, That it has been objected, (and may be again) <hi>That my Zeal in the Cauſe appears too late; and that it would
<pb facs="tcp:49679:13"/>have been more ſeaſonable, had it ſhewed it ſelf, when Things of this Nature, and (at leaſt) relating to this Subject, were lately and hotly debated from the Preſs:</hi> And, <hi>That the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I undertake, has already been, and that ſeveral Times, diſcuſſed by Learned Men and Great Names.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all this, and more, muſt not weigh with one, who is perſuaded, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all paſt Endeavours, <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Immorality</hi> do ſtill go on, and gain Ground; and that we ought in Honeſty ſtill to apply Remedies, as we find the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion ſpread; and that according to the various Conſtitutions of the Patients, a leſs promiſing ſort of Phyſick may ſometimes work a Cure, where a more likely, and that too from a more celebrated Hand, has fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſhort. Something more might be ſaid, and that Something true: But I think what is ſaid in ſhort, enough in the Caſe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49679:14"/>
                  <p>To conclude then; I would deſire eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader, to lay aſide all Prejudice, by whatſoever Means contracted; Whether from an <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>other</hi> Mens great Worth, or a <hi>Conceit</hi> of their <hi>own;</hi> Whether from a <hi>Security,</hi> that they are already in the <hi>Right,</hi> or a <hi>Shame</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, tho' they find themſelves in the <hi>Wrong;</hi> Whether from Vice, or Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, or from any other Cauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And I do ſolemnly profeſs, that what I deſire them to do in the <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that I have all along endeavoured to do in the <hi>Writing</hi> of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For, I have, as far as my ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Talent goes, had my Eye all along directed to <hi>Truth,</hi> to the <hi>Honour</hi> of my Great <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> and to the <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Souls.</hi> And may his Grace, which is alone able to do it, make it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for thoſe Great and Holy Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: That ſo Men may be perſuaded, not to be ſo fooliſhly wicked, as to entertain cheap Thoughts of, and much leſs to revile
<pb facs="tcp:49679:14"/>and blaſpheme <hi>Him,</hi> in whoſe Hand is lodged all Power in Heaven and Earth, who ſhall be their Judge, and <hi>who alone muſt be their Saviour.</hi> And it is this Laſt Propoſition which the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe attempts to make good.</p>

                     <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>SAlvation</hi> implies in the very Notion of it, either the <hi>Prevention</hi> of ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, to which we are <hi>obnoxious;</hi> or a <hi>Deliverance</hi> from ſome Miſchief, which we <hi>actually ſuffer.</hi> Now becauſe it is our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Deſign and Buſineſs at preſent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Salvation of Mankind by our Saviour; therefore, in order to our ſo doing, it will be proper firſt to conſider, what Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief it is from which they are ſaved. For the true Knowledge of the <hi>Occaſion</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>Miſchief,</hi> will very much aſſiſt us in our Enquiries into the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of ſuch <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We muſt know therefore, That when God, who made Man, and all Things beſide, had placed Man in this lower World; as he did
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49679:18"/>provide for his <hi>Well-being</hi> by his <hi>Bounty,</hi> ſo he did provide for his <hi>greater Happineſs</hi> by his <hi>Law.</hi> For by the <hi>firſt</hi> he only put all <hi>Creatures</hi> here in ſubjection to <hi>Man;</hi> but by the <hi>laſt,</hi> he acquainted <hi>Man</hi> with his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to <hi>Himſelf.</hi> For it is an undoubted Truth, That it is a greater Happineſs, to be a true Subject to God, than it is to be Tenant of the whole Earth, and a deputed Lord over all the Creatures in it.</p>
                     <p>Now, in order to ſome few Remarks, which we ſhall make upon God's firſt Law given to Man, and which will open a Way to our main Deſign; it will be convenient, that we lay down the Law as it was given forth. Thus therefore it ſtands: <hi>Of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it: For in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> or, as it is in the Original, <hi>dying thou ſhalt die:</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplication in that Language being equivalent to an Aſſeveration in ours. It has been a Doubt among Learned Men, whether this firſt Law be a <hi>Moral,</hi> or only a <hi>Poſitive</hi> Law. Now for the Reſolution of ſuch Doubt, it may not be improper to conſider apart, Firſt, What is expreſly <hi>contained</hi> in the <hi>Law;</hi> and, Secondly, What is <hi>implied</hi> under ſuch <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And firſt, If we only conſider the expreſs Words of the Law, which forbid the eating of the Fruit of the Tree ſpecified; the Law
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49679:18"/>in ſuch Caſe is therefore <hi>Poſitive,</hi> not <hi>Moral,</hi> becauſe before the Prohibition there was no more Immorality in eating of <hi>that</hi> Tree, than of any <hi>other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then, ſecondly, If we farther conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that tho' the Law, as to the particular Thing prohibited, was purely Arbitrary, and therefore ſo far forth only Poſitive; yet that the Prohibition did imply in it a Moral Duty, grounded upon very equitable Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we may conclude, that under this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and Poſitive Law, there is implied and couched a Moral Law. For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> God gave Man not only his <hi>Being,</hi> but alſo all Things for the neceſſary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient <hi>Support</hi> of ſuch Being: and from thence we may by our Natural Reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves, that his ſo doing was a very equitable Conſideration, why Man ſhould be bound up in Gratitude (and that is as much, as being bound up in Morality) to acknowledge the Kindneſs and Bounty of his Great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man being bound in Gratitude to acknowledge the <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Bounty;</hi> we may truly add, that he was farther bound to acknowledge ſuch Kindneſs and Bounty in ſuch <hi>Way,</hi> as ſuch his Benefactor ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God having made the Earth, and all Things in it; he might grant as many, or as few of the Things ſo made, to Man, as he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49679:19"/>himſelf pleaſed: And therefore might except any one, or more of them, out of ſuch Grant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God having an undoubted Power of Reſerving to himſelf what he pleaſed out of thoſe Things, which he had made; he might in Juſtice and Equity require, that Man ſhould give one Teſtimony of his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, by abſtaining from what he ſhould pleaſe ſo to reſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God by ſingling out the Forbidden Tree from all the reſt, and by ſo doing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it to himſelf, had made that a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mark and Signal of his own rightful and ſupreme <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Whole; as alſo, for the ſame Reaſon, of <hi>Man's Tenure</hi> and <hi>Subjection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> As we may ſuppoſe the Forbidden Tree to have ſtood in the midſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, from the Ninth Verſe of the Second Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> ſo a Tree ſo placed was by its very Situation a very fit and proper Thing to be made uſe of for ſuch a purpoſe; becauſe being (in ſome meaſure at leaſt) equidiſtant from the Boundaries of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grant, it muſt for that Reaſon be moſt likely to preſent it ſelf to <hi>Adam</hi>'s View, to whatever Part of the Garden he moved; and by ſo doing muſt conſtantly, or at leaſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put him in mind of the Nature of his Tenure, <hi>viz.</hi> that he held it of him, who had ſetled him in the Poſſeſſion and Uſe of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49679:19"/>all the reſt. So that, as the Law is <hi>Poſitive,</hi> if we only look upon the <hi>expreſs</hi> Words of it; ſo it is <hi>Moral,</hi> if we conſider what is implied in it. And therefore, as the <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> and <hi>direct Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the Law was the eating the <hi>forbidden Fruit;</hi> ſo the <hi>couched Immorality</hi> of ſuch Tranſgreſſion was an <hi>Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> upon God's <hi>Prerogative</hi> in this lower World, and an Encroachment upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Rights and Demeans of the Supreme Lord. The Tranſgreſſion of the <hi>expreſs</hi> Law then was a Sin againſt God's <hi>Command:</hi> But the Tranſgreſſion of the <hi>implied</hi> Law was a Sin againſt his <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Supreme Right.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> was a <hi>Sin,</hi> becauſe it did what God had expreſly <hi>forbid:</hi> The <hi>laſt</hi> was implicitly <hi>forbid,</hi> becauſe it was a <hi>Sin;</hi> and therefore was a Sin, tho' God did not expreſly forbid it. The <hi>firſt</hi> was therefore only unlawful, becauſe <hi>forbidden:</hi> The <hi>laſt</hi> was unlawful in <hi>it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To ſum up all in a few Words: Tho' the Deſignation of the particular Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tree in the midſt of the Garden, was Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and therefore Poſitive; yet the Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Something was, as Juſt and Wiſe, ſo (I may add) Moral and Neceſſary too; at leaſt ſo far as it is ſo, that God's Supreme Right ought to be aſſerted and owned. For, ſo far forth the Prohibition given to Man, of eating of the Fruit of any Tree marked out, or of medling with any Thing elſe, is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49679:20"/>upon the Antecedent and Eternal Rules of Reaſon and Juſtice, that is, of Morality.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, tho' the <hi>expreſs</hi> Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law be only <hi>Poſitive;</hi> yet the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Prohibition is at leaſt ſo far <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> as it is ſo, That Man, by ſome Means or other, ſhould acknowledge God to be his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord, and that he receives from him whatſoever he enjoys; and that if God do expreſly appoint the Way and Means of his ſo doing, he ought to do it by the Way and Means ſo appointed.</p>
                     <p>And I therefore ſay <hi>(expreſly)</hi> becauſe ſo far as the Words of the Law under our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſideration do go, it is notorious, that what is <hi>expreſly</hi> prohibited by it, is only <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi> and <hi>Poſitive:</hi> But that the <hi>Morality</hi> of the Prohibition is <hi>not</hi> expreſſed, but (at the moſt) but <hi>couched</hi> and <hi>implied.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By what has been ſpoken, we may learn,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Sin expreſly prohibited by the Law may therefore truly be eſteemed a leſſer Sin, becauſe it is only a Sin againſt a Poſitive Law. For, ſuch a Sin is a Sin only againſt God's Authority: Whereas a Sin that contains a Natural Immorality in it (if I may ſo ſpeak) is a Sin both againſt God's Authority, and againſt his Purity and Holineſs too.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the expreſs Penalty of the Law is only a Puniſhment threatned againſt the Tranſgreſſion of the expreſs Prohibition of the Law. For it does not look like Juſtice,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49679:20"/>to aſſign an expreſs Puniſhment in the Law, for the Tranſgreſſion of any Thing, which is not expreſly contained in the Law.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such Puniſhment ſo threatned againſt the Tranſgreſſion of the expreſs Law, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, abſolute, and peremtory. <hi>Adam</hi> then did therefore fatally ſuffer the Penalty of the Law, becauſe he ſinned againſt an expreſs Prohibition, which was ratified by an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, peremptory, and expreſs Threat. For God may therefore be thought to be obliged by his Truth to puniſh <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion according to the expreſs Threat of the Law, becauſe he had paſſed his more ſolemn Word, that he would do ſo. And as he was obliged by his Truth to puniſh it as the Law had threatned; ſo he was obliged to puniſh it, becauſe it was a Sin: For ſo, undoubtedly, is the Tranſgreſſion of any of God's Laws.</p>
                     <p>From hence it may be concluded, that we all die a temporal Death for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin. For, as we were in the Loins of him in the day of his Tranſgreſſion; ſo God has not by any other Law aſſigned an Univerſal Mortality as the Puniſhment of Sin. And ſo ſpeaks the Scripture; <hi>In Adam all died.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. As the Moral Law couched in the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law is not expreſs, ſo neither is there any expreſs Puniſhment threatned to the Tranſgreſſion of ſuch couched Law. For while Man was in a State of Innocence, as there was no need that God ſhould preſcribe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49679:21"/>him any expreſs Law to guide him in ſuch Things, which were in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good; becauſe the dictates of his own reaſon were of themſelves ſufficient for ſuch his guidance (for Moral Goodneſs is nothing elſe, but the Dictates of right Reaſon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the Actions of Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures): So, for the ſame Reaſon, there was no occaſion to threaten him in that Caſe with any expreſs Penalty; becauſe the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an expreſs Penalty antecedent to the Commiſſion of the Crime, can only be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per there, where there is an expreſs Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a Duty: Whereas Man had never by his Reaſon known, that it had been a Sin to eat of any Fruit, which kindly offer'd it ſelf to his View, and natural Inclinations, if ſuch Fruit had not been forbidden by ſome expreſs Law. And therefore, for the ſame Reaſon, that it was neceſſary, that ſuch Law ſhould be expreſs; it was neceſſary, that the Penalty of ſuch Law ſhould be expreſs too.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As the Sin againſt the Moral Duty, which is only implied in the Law (were that Duty ſuppoſed to be expreſs Law) is greater than the Sin againſt the expreſs, but Poſitive Law; ſo (were there a Puniſhment to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſigned to ſuch Sin) it muſt in Juſtice be greater than the Puniſhment aſſigned to the leſs Sin, that is, to the Tranſgreſſion of the Poſitive Law. The Puniſhment therefore aſſigned by the expreſs Law to the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49679:21"/>of it, being only Death, and that too (as appears from the Nineteenth Verſe of the Third Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi>) a temporal Death; our Reaſon, and that natural Senſe we have of the Proportions of Juſtice, will aſſure us, that the Law, which forbids a greater Sin, than this Law does, muſt in Reaſon and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aſſign an heavier Puniſhment to ſuch great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sin.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Such heavier Puniſhment muſt ſuppoſe a Reſurrection. For, a greater Puniſhment than Death cannot therefore be inflicted upon a dead Man, without a Reſurrection; becauſe no Puniſhment at all can be ſo inflicted upon him. For where there is no Senſation, there can be no Puniſhment; and a dead Man can have no Senſation, unleſs we could ſuppoſe him to be alive, and dead at the ſame time. This Head may meet with Objections; but I ſhall wave them, and any Anſwer to them, at preſent; and that too ſo much the rather, becauſe it is notorious, that the Scriptures do lay the greater Puniſhment, that is, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment greater than Death, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Reſurrection, but alſo beyond the laſt Judgment it-ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Laſtly: In ſuch Places of Scripture, where the greater Puniſhment is threatned, it is not (as the Puniſhment of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Poſitive Law was) abſolute and peremptory, but only conditional. And therefore if we except, <hi>firſt,</hi> the Sin againſt the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49679:22"/>Holy Ghoſt, (whatever that be; for it does not concern us to enquire at preſent); and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> The Refuſing the Conditions of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered in a Saviour, that grand and comprehenſive Sin, which either neglects or renounces the only Means appointed for Man's Salvation from all his other Sins; I ſay, if we except theſe Two Caſes (if yet they be Two) not only the future Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned againſt the Breach of this or that Law, but of any, or all, may (as far as the Goſpel-diſcoveries go) be remitted.</p>
                     <p>Which may teach us to think, that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment threatned in the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> was not a Puniſhment after a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but a Puniſhment without a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And that, not only becauſe at that Time, when the Law was given to him, there was not only no Reſurrection promiſed; but no Saviour neither, by whom alone a Reſurrection was to be brought to paſs. To which we may add, That the Death threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Adam</hi> by the Law given to him, was (as we have ſeen) upon his Tranſgreſſion of ſuch Law, abſolute and peremptory; and that the Execution of ſuch Threat is (as the Scripture and our Experience tells us) abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and univerſal. Whereas the Threat of an eternal Death, as we are well aſſured, is, upon the Breach of God's Laws, only condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. Now it looks hard to our Reaſon, that when only Death is threatned in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49679:22"/>Law, and that Death at the very moſt but indefinite, to ſay, that the Death ſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned does imply a double Death, that is, both a Temporal and Eternal Death. And it looks harder yet, to ſay, that the Threat and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of one of the Deaths is abſolute and univerſal; but that the Threat and Execution of the other is only partial and conditional. For our Reaſon tells us, that neither any Threat nor Execution of Death can be both Abſolute and Conditional; both Univerſal and Particular too.</p>
                     <p>From the Whole we take notice, That tho God was obliged both by his Truth and Juſtice to execute the Threatning againſt the Tranſgreſſion of the firſt Law; becauſe that Law being given to Man in his Innocence, (that is, before he ſtood in need of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and therefore before God had promiſed one) the Threat of Puniſhment upon the Breach of the Law was (as we have ſeen) abſolute and peremptory: Yet becauſe the Revelation of a future and everlaſting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in the New Covenant, is rather made by way of Information, than by way of peremptory Threat, and abſolute Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; therefore God is obliged to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch Penalty only by his Juſtice, but not at all by his Veracity.</p>
                     <p>If then there be a Means provided to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie ſuch his Juſtice, without the rigorous Execution of ſuch declared, and (without
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49679:23"/>ſuch Means) certain Penalty; it will well enough follow, That ſuch Penalty may be remitted, without any Prejudice either to his Juſtice, or to his Truth. And therefore, in what is to follow, we truſt to make it good, That our Lord and Saviour <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> may and will juſtly ſave us from the Puniſhment peremptorily threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Loſs of Life executed upon him and all Mankind) by releaſing us from it after we have ſuffer'd it; and from a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eternal Puniſhment (expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the New Teſtament to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and probably alſo after the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Promiſe of the Seed of the Woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the Patriarchs, and by God's Church among the <hi>Jews</hi>) by preventing it.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Scriptures do moſt expreſly aſſert, That Mankind are redeemed by the Blood of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. <hi>It is not agreeable to the Divine Wiſdom, or to the Method of his Proceedings in the like Caſes, to employ greater Means to bring his Purpoſes to paſs, where leſs may be ſufficient. Puniſhment is the neceſſary Wages of Sin. An Objection to this Poſition anſwered.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND as we have grounded what we have ſaid in the <hi>Introduction</hi> upon the Revelations of God, which have acquainted us how Sin, and the Puniſhment of it, Death, entred into the World: So, in what is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low concerning the Redemption of Mankind both from Sin and Puniſhment, we ſhall take our Riſe from Revelation likewiſe: Not only becauſe we had known nothing of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but by Revelation; but alſo becauſe, in the preſent Caſe, Revelation is undoubtedly the beſt Guide of our Reaſon. For, Reaſon muſt of neceſſity be guided beſt by that, without the Guidance of which, Reaſon it ſelf is confeſſedly blind. And we are very ſure, that it becomes all thoſe, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Scriptures to be the Revelations of God; I ſay, it becomes them, in modeſty
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49679:24"/>and deference to the Author, and in prudence for their own more certain Conduct, rather to endeavour to bring their Reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Revelation, than to bring the Revelation to comply with their Reaſon. And therefore that we our ſelves may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what we cannot but judge to be beſt in the Practice of others, we ſhall lay the Ground-work of all that is to follow, upon the Words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Fourth of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the Twelfth Verſe; <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other: For there is no other Name under Heaven given among Men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt be ſaved.</hi> In which Words the Apoſtle, and he too at that time filled with the Holy-Ghoſt (as appears by the Eighth Verſe) does expreſly tell us (for the Words do import ſo much) That Men muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> (conſult the Tenth Verſe) and by no other.</p>
                     <p>For it is evident, that by <hi>Name</hi> in the Text is meant <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf; becauſe what he calls <hi>[Name]</hi> in one Part of the Verſe, is oppoſed to <hi>[any other]</hi> in the other Part of the Verſe: As in the Tenth Verſe he tells us, <hi>that the impotent Man was made whole by the [Name] of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and that <hi>he was made whole by [Him],</hi> that is, by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the latter end of the Verſe.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who profeſſedly and avowedly make it their Buſineſs to evacuate the Purchaſe of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49679:24"/>Our Saviour's Merits and Blood, do to that purpoſe ſtart, if not an impertinent, yet a very ſawcie Queſtion; which is, Whether or no God could not have ſaved ſinful Man by ſome other Means, than by the Death of his Son? And by that means would alter that very Queſtion, (which they alone have made a Queſtion) <hi>viz.</hi> Whether <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> died for the Sins of Men? I ſay, they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it into another Queſtion, neither fit to be diſputed, nor poſſible to be determined by ſhort-ſighted Men; <hi>viz.</hi> What God can do, and what God cannot do? Whereas it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for us to take Things as we find them; and if we find, that Things in the preſent Caſe are ſo ordered by God, and that he tells us, that they are ſo, as that ſinful Man ſhall not obtain Redemption but only by the Merits and Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> their Saviour: I ſay, if God tells us, and that too by repeated Declarations, that Things in the preſent Caſe are ſo ordered; we ought to acquieſce in ſuch his Declarations, and not employ our Vanity or Curioſity (for it can in no ſober Senſe be call'd our Reaſon) in enquiring <hi>Whether,</hi> much leſs in determining <hi>that</hi> they <hi>might</hi> or might <hi>not</hi> have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordered. But of this more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>At preſent therefore, and in the firſt place, we ſhall take the Matter of Fact to be juſt as the Scriptures have in moſt plain and expreſs Words told us it is; That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> died
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49679:25"/>for our Sins; that he died to ſave Sinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then, by comparing this Matter of Fact with other the Methods of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the like Caſes, ſee if it will not afford us a very plauſible Argument of the Truth laid down, <hi>That there is not Salvation in any other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if we carry our Obſervation through any other the Tranſactions of the Divine Love and Mercy, that do deſign to entitle Men to the ſame Salvation, we ſhall find, that God does never make uſe of extraordinary Means, where the ordinary are ſufficient. And therefore, when the Lord himſelf appeared to <hi>Saul</hi> in his Journey to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> we find, that the Deſign and Effect of that Viſion was to refer him to <hi>Ananias</hi> for Inſtructions in his Duty. And ſo when the Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the Buſineſs of his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was only to direct him to <hi>Peter,</hi> that ſo <hi>Peter might</hi> by the ordinary Means of Grace direct him into the Way of Salvation. And when Men have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, it will therefore concern them in Duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to hear them, becauſe in ſuch Caſe God will not convince them by raiſing one from the Dead. In ſhort, as it is not the Method of the Divine Proceedings, ſo neither is it of Wiſdom it ſelf, to let the Meaſure of the Means exceed in their Proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned End. And in any Caſe whatſoever, where <hi>leſs</hi> Coſt or Labour is ſufficient, there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49679:25"/>common Prudence will by no means <hi>allow,</hi> and much leſs <hi>approve</hi> our Drudgery or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs. Now to bring what we have ſaid to our preſent purpoſe:</p>
                     <p>Since our Saviour, for the Eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel-Covenant, did actually take upon him Our Fleſh, and in that Fleſh ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; it will afford us no ſlight Argument, that That Covenant could not have been eſtabliſhed upon more eaſie Conditions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our common Reaſon does aſſure us, that all Exceſs of Performance in the Caſe would have been Superfluity: And our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Modeſty does forbid us to faſten any ſuch Imputation upon the Divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Actions. And here we may well put <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> And when by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his Mercy he determined to reſcue faln Man from Sin and Miſery, ſhall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Son of his Boſom, and expoſe him to all ſorts of Miſery in this World, and to Violence and Barbarity in his Departure out of it; when the Ranſom might have been made at a cheaper Rate? Certainly the Love of God is not ſo narrow and ſtinted, but that he both could and would have extended it to his loſt Creatures, and yet at the ſame time not have removed it from his only and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, if Juſtice and Wiſdom had allowed him ſo to do. But then, becauſe he himſelf tells us, that he did otherwiſe; and becauſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49679:26"/>we know, that what he tells us, muſt be true; as well as, that what he does, is juſt and holy; therefore the Concluſion, that fairly offers it ſelf, is, That nothing leſs than the Incarnation, and Death of the Son of God could in Wiſdom and Juſtice have brought about the deſigned Redemption. To which we ſhall in ſhort add, That it is one of the certain Characters of the True God, that he brings his Purpoſes to paſs by the beſt, wiſeſt, and moſt proper Means.</p>
                     <p>And now having thus opened our Way to our main Deſign, by theſe few Reflexions on the Matter of Fact, as it is laid down moſt expreſly in the Scriptures: We ſhall in what follows go on to conſider the Merits of the Cauſe; and that we ſhall do, by examining, Whether or no Mankind had not brought themſelves into ſo forlorn a Condition by their Sin, that there does not appear in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice any probable, or indeed any poſſible Way for their Salvation, but only by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Death of the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>And that there did not, will (I preſume) appear, when we have conſidered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the following Propoſitions; whereof the</p>
                     <p>Firſt is, <hi>That Miſery and Death, or, in one word, that Vengeance is, as the Juſt, ſo alſo the Neceſſary Wages of Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here, before we begin, to prevent, as much as poſſible, all Objections that may be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49679:26"/>ſtarted againſt what we ſhall deliver, we muſt deſire the Reader to take notice, that we do at preſent only make it our Buſineſs to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Equity of the Puniſhment of Sin by the exact and rigorous Laws of Juſtice: That is, we do (as we muſt, if we will do right) conceive Things in that State, in which they had ſtood, had the Son of God never been deſigned for the Saviour of the World. For, becauſe our Buſineſs at preſent is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what would have become of ſinful Man, if the Son of God had not interpoſed for his Reſcue; therefore we ſtand obliged at preſent to take other Meaſures in accounting for the Proceedings of the Divine Juſtice, than what our Experience acquaints us with in this World. For while we live here, we come within the <hi>Compaſs,</hi> and ſo enjoy the <hi>Benefit</hi> of that Relaxation of the Law, which was the Purchaſe of our Saviour's Merits; and therefore we cannot truly paſs a Judgment upon the exact Proceedings of the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, from the Contemplations of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Juſtice which we ſee in this World, and which, upon that account, come within the compaſs of that Relaxation. To know therefore, whether the Incarnation, Life, and Death of our Saviour were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Man's Redemption, we muſt enquire, what had become of ſinful Man, if the Son of God had not become his Saviour. And if upon that Enquiry it ſhall appear, that Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49679:27"/>without any Remedy had been his Portion; then it will alſo appear (at leaſt) a probable Concluſion (for we ſhall adventure no farther, becauſe we are utter Strangers to the unſearchable Depths of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) That Mankind had brought themſelves into ſo forlorn a Condition by their Sin, that there does not appear to us any poſſible or juſt Way for their Redemption, but only by the Incarnation, Life, and Death of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Saviour, the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>This Caution then being laid down, and well obſerved, the Firſt Propoſition, <hi>viz. That Puniſhment or Vengeance is the Juſt and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Wages of Sin,</hi> will appear more eaſie and rational.</p>
                     <p>And for aſſerting the Truth of it, we lay it down in the</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt place, <hi>That God is in his own Nature Holy.</hi> This does neceſſarily fall in with our very Notion of a God; becauſe it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to our very Conceptions of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſuppoſe any Wickedneſs or Turpitude in him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We lay it down, ſecondly, <hi>That God loves himſelf.</hi> This will eaſily be allowed, for more Reaſons than one; both becauſe the Notion is Natural and Univerſal, that all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Things do ſo; as alſo becauſe God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſuppoſed to be the moſt Noble and Adequate, as well as Natural Object (if I may ſo ſpeak) of his own Love. Nay, ſome
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49679:27"/>Men have ſtreined this Point ſo far, as to tell us, that the great and infinite Complacency that God takes in himſelf, and in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, would never have allowed him to condeſcend to his Work of Creation, and by that Means to have allowed any of his Love and Good-will to low, mean, and inferiour Creatures (as the beſt of Creatures are, if compared to him) if the Son, who is the Word of God, had not interpoſed upon that Occaſion; and ſo they make him a Mediator of Creation, as well as of Redemption. But laying that aſide at preſent, as being nothing to our purpoſe; it may ſuffice for our Deſign, that whatever Love God bears to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it cannot be ſuppoſed, but that he not only loves, but that he does alſo chiefly, and in the firſt place, love himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Two Things then being laid down, <hi>That God loves himſelf;</hi> and, <hi>That he is in his Nature Holy;</hi> the Inference that we ſhall make, before we proceed any farther, muſt be, That he cannot otherwiſe chuſe but hate and abhor whatſoever is contrary to ſuch his Nature: And, becauſe all Sin and Wickedneſs is ſo; that therefore he cannot chuſe but hate and abhor all Sin and Wickedneſs. And hence it is, that the Scripture acquaints us, that <hi>the carnal mind is enmity with God;</hi> that is, all Sin and Wickedneſs is ſo. For we may as rationally conceive, that a Man, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains and makes much of Sin, does love
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49679:28"/>God; as we may, that God, who in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Holy, can love Sin, which is directly contrary to ſuch his Holineſs. This Inference then, from the Two former Propoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in ſhort laid down, and made good; we go on, and add in the</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Third place, <hi>That the Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all God's Creatures is only the Effect of the Divine Good-will and Pleaſure.</hi> For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, <hi>it was he that made us, and not we our-ſelves.</hi> And taking it for granted at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that he did ſo; I would in the next place enquire, Whether we did deſerve ſuch our Beings, or not? If it be anſwered, That we did not; then we have what we deſire, and that is, that the great and firſt Bleſſing, that ever God beſtowed upon us, was by him freely beſtowed, without any poſſible Merit in us; and therefore, that it was the free Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his Good-will and Pleaſure. But if any Man ſhall be ſo ſilly, as to think, that he could deſerve his Being of God; then to make good ſuch his Conceit, it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected (and that too, for ever; for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation will never be anſwered) that he ſhould make it out, that Nothing may have Something of Merit in it; and, that what as yet is not, may have wherewithal to lay an Obligation upon Omnipotence.</p>
                     <p>And as our Being was the free Effect of the Divine Good-will and Pleaſure; ſo alſo are all thoſe Bleſſings which do attend it. For
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49679:28"/>with our Beings he did alſo beſtow upon us all thoſe Faculties, which ſhould entertain any other Thing whatſoever. And as he made our Faculties, ſo did he all Things elſe, which can poſſibly gratifie thoſe Faculties. And that there is any Harmony or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between thoſe Faculties, and their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is undoubtedly owing to him, who was the original Contriver and Author of both. And therefore in the</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourth place, I would offer it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <hi>That it is only the Exerciſe of God's Good-will towards us, that does indeed and truth make way for the Exerciſe of his Juſtice upon us;</hi> Becauſe we could never have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the Severity of the laſt, if we had never been made Partakers of the Bounty of the firſt: And therefore, when God does puniſh us for our Sins by his Juſtice, that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment does nothing elſe, but only ſtrip us of ſomething, which we had before received from his Mercy. And this, upon a ſerious Conſideration, will appear to be true, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Puniſhment inflicted do deprive us of our Eaſe, Peace, Safety, or even of Life it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For, <hi>what have we, that we did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;</hi> ſince <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our Being?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Fifthly, I would offer it to Conſideration, Whether when God takes any Thing from us, which, upon the account of his Good-will and Pleaſure, he had beſtowed upon us; I ſay,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49679:29"/>Whether in ſuch a Caſe the true and juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why he does ſo, is not, becauſe we by our Sins have turned ſuch his Good-will towards us, into his Diſpleaſure againſt us? For, if what he beſtowed was the Effect of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; and if (as God made us holy and upright at firſt) he cannot but continue the ſame Good-will towards us, ſo long as we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as he made us: Then we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſo long as he continues ſuch his Good-will towards us, ſo long he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Effects of ſuch his Good-will too. And if we were not aſſured of this, then it might be all one as to us, whether God were well-pleaſed with us, and loved us, or not. For, if the Loſs of ſuch good Things, which are the Eſſects of God's Good-will to us, may (while we continue holy and innocent) be once made conſiſtent with ſuch his Good-will; then farewel to all Diſtinction as to the Juſtice of Rewards and Puniſhments: For, in ſuch a Caſe it may be the ſame thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we pleaſe God, or diſpleaſe him; becauſe we may loſe the Effects of his Favour, that is (according to the Tenor of the laſt Head) we may be puniſhed as well for our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as for our Wickedneſs; or, at the very beſt, we may be puniſhed for Nothing. No! no! As God's Diſpleaſure is contrary to his Good-will and Favour; ſo the Eſſects and Conſequences of that Diſpleaſure muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Effects and Conſequences of ſuch
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49679:29"/>his Good-will and Favour too. This is the Voice of Nature, and this the Voice of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and therefore alſo this is the Voice of Truth. And then, as we ſhewed before, that all the good Things, that we do or can enjoy, did proceed purely and meerly from God's Good-will; ſo I do now add, that our Sins do naturally turn that Good-will into Diſpleaſure; and then the Good-will ceaſing, all thoſe Emanations, that flowed from it, muſt in courſe ceaſe alſo. And then, becauſe where they ceaſe, there the Sinner's Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does begin; therefore we may now from the Whole begin to perceive, that the Puniſhment of Sin is not ſo arbitrarious a thing, as it is uſually taken to be; but that it does, when traced to the beginning, depend upon the ſame Neceſſity, by which God loves himſelf. For, if we ſum up all our Diſcourſe upon this Head from the beginning, we ſhall underſtand, That God loves himſelf; That he is in his own Nature Holy; That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hates whatſoever is contrary to ſuch his Nature; That all Sin therefore is ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contrary to his Holineſs; That the Effects of his Hatred muſt be contrary to thoſe of his Love; or, at the very beſt, That the Emanations of his Love muſt then be ſtopped, when that Love is turned into Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Diſpleaſure; That when his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures loſe thoſe Emanations, then their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery begins; That all thoſe Creatures muſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49679:30"/>needs loſe them, that loſe that Love, from whence alone they do proceed; and, That they loſe that Love by their Sins; becauſe (as we ſaid before) Sin, and Sin alone, does turn it into Hatred and Diſpleaſure. So that (if we may be allowd ſo to ſpeak in Morality) there is an eſſential Relation between Sin and Puniſhment; and the Neceſſity of Puniſhment (when narrowly ſcann'd) is founded upon the eternal and immutable Laws of Truth, Holineſs, and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>But before we leave this Head, I would (if that be poſſible) make all a little plainer by an Inſtance: And that Inſtance ſhall be in that Puniſhment, which the firſt Sin brought upon the whole Race of Mankind. And I do the rather take my Inſtance there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law was given and broken, and ſo the Penalty both threatned and incurred, when there was no Saviour to remit the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous but juſt Execution of ſuch Penalty.</p>
                     <p>Now we are aſſured by the Reaſon of the Thing it-ſelf; (as we have already diſcourſed) But if that will not do, we are aſſured by God's Word, by his Promiſe, by his Oath, that he neither <hi>wills,</hi> nor <hi>delights in the death of a Sinner.</hi> And when he ſwears ſo to us, it would be both proper and modeſt in us to believe, that there is ſomething in Sin, which does oblige God in Juſtice (and that is the ſame thing with God, as to be obliged by Neceſſity) to puniſh it with Death. And to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49679:30"/>this purpoſe we may take notice, that it is derogatory to God's Honour, for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve any Puniſhment, which we ſuffer, into God's Will only, and not into his Juſtice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as we ſhall preſently perceive) when God wills the Death of a Sinner, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only wills it, becauſe Juſtice does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and that (in the Nature of the Thing) antecedently to ſuch his Will. For, if the Death of a Man ſhould be therefore juſt, only becauſe God wills it, tho' the Man do not deſerve it; then it may be all one as to the Event, and that juſtly too, whether a Man were perfectly innocent, or the moſt profligate Miſcreant upon the Face of the Earth. For, according to that Doctrine, which we now oppoſe, God might in ſuch a Caſe juſtly will the Death of the Innocent, and ſave the Criminal alive. For, if the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Reſolution of the Juſtice of our Death be only into the Will of God, then nothing can hinder, but that God may juſtly ſlay a perfect Innocent. And ſo when God told <hi>Adam,</hi> that in the day of his Tranſgreſſion he ſhould ſurely die; the Meaning of his Threat muſt have been, that he might have died, whether he had tranſgreſſed or not. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot without Blaſphemy tax God's Law of ſuch notorious Prevarication; therefore we muſt determine, that the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Reſolution of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Puniſhment in ſuch Caſe, muſt be into the Deſert of ſuch
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49679:31"/>Puniſhment by the Breach of the Law, and that God's willing his Death was a juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of ſuch his Deſert. In ſhort; God wills ſuch things only, which he can will juſtly; and he, who will rationally, and truly account for the Proceedings of God, in that and ſuch like Caſes, muſt have a care to do it ſo, as to maintain the Harmony of all his Attributes. He muſt not magnifie his Power, no nor his Mercy ſo, as to impeach his Truth, Wiſdom, and Juſtice: For he, who confounds the Events of Innocence and Guilt, will be found (when his Opinion comes nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to be ſcanned) to make God either a Favourer of Sin, or an Enemy of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Sum of all is, That when God tells us, that <hi>Death is the Wages of Sin,</hi> he does not therefore paſs it into a Law, becauſe it pleaſes him ſo to do; but becauſe it is juſt in it-ſelf, that he ſhould do ſo: And that if it had not been juſt in it-ſelf, he had not upon that ſingle Account willed it at all. So that upon the whole, it does remain a fixed and ſetled Truth, That Death is the Wages of Sin by the eternal and immutable Laws of Iuſtice and that it cannot be otherwiſe, ſo long as God loves himſelf, and ſo hates whatſoever is contrary to himſelf and to his Nature, as all Sin moſt undoubtedly is. And therefore when any Man ſins againſt God, as by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he does of neceſſity forfeit God's Favour; ſo alſo by conſequence, he does by neceſſity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49679:31"/>forfeit his own Life, which has nothing elſe to depend upon, but that Favour alone.</p>
                     <p>And as a Temporal Death upon Sin is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe both threatned and incurred before the Promiſe of a Saviour; ſo after the Saviour has laid down his Mediatorial Office, an Eternal Death will be found to be ſo too. I word it ſo, leſt my Caution before this Head ſhould by this time be forgot. Now, if it be not an Eternal Law of Juſtice, that Puniſhment is the neceſſary Reward of Sin; then it may be all one, as to the Event, (and that juſtly and finally too) whether a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this Life the beſt or the worſt Man in the whole World. For, if there be not ſome Law of Juſtice, that ſhall at the laſt Day diſtinguiſh the Event of their contrary Courſes, then nothing can: And if that Juſtice be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary (let the Means, by which it is not ſo, be what they will) the Difference between their Condition can be but <hi>caſual,</hi> (or at the very beſt, but <hi>arbitrary</hi>) and ſo we muſt leave them both to a grand <hi>Perhaps;</hi> which will be in effect to deſtroy all Religion and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing againſt this Diſcourſe, of weight and moment; which tho' I ſhall profeſſedly anſwer in another Place, yet ſhall not go unmentioned here: And that is, That if the Puniſhment of Sin be abſolutely juſt and neceſſary, then how came it to paſs, that God did in his Counſel deſign, and in his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

                     <p n="3">3. But then, <hi>thirdly,</hi> It is a Miſtake, that the Salvation of Man from Puniſhment was the immediate and direct Deſign in God's Counſel of ſending a Saviour. For, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, [See <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.] the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Saviour's Coming was to bring back Mankind to his Father's Kingdom, who had been drawn into a Revolt from his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Juriſdiction, by the Sollicitations of the Devil, and had thereby put a Slight upon the Authority of the King of all the World, and ſo, in ſome ſenſe, leſned the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his Kingdom.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49679:33"/>to Holineſs; and ſo was not properly the Deſign of God's ſending a Saviour, but the Conſequence of the Succeſs of ſuch Deſign.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Goſpel holds forth no ſuch thing, as an Abſolute or Unconditional Pardon; no, nor yet an Arbitrary Pardon.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe next and Second Propoſition offered to be made good, in order to our main Deſign, is this; <hi>That the Goſpel holds out no ſuch thing to us, as an abſolute Forgiveneſs of Sin.</hi> Which Propoſition I therefore lay down here, not only becauſe it is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to ſome Things, which are to follow; but alſo to obviate the Conceit of thoſe Men, who think they do ſufficiently wipe away the Merits of our Saviour in reference to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our Sins, by telling us, that God may without any more ado pardon ſuch our Sins by his Free Grace.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But, in the firſt place, we cannot but take notice, that what God <hi>may</hi> do, and what he has declared he <hi>will</hi> do, are Two very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and diſtinct Things. Though therefore it be ſuppoſed, that God <hi>may</hi> grant us an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Pardon; yet if in thoſe very Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which he has diſcovered to us his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of pardoning us, he does expreſly tell
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49679:33"/>us, that he will <hi>not</hi> do ſo; it will be proper and modeſt in us, to acquieſce in what he ſo tells us, rather than to raiſe in our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conceited Poſſibilities, which do direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict ſuch his Declarations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But, ſecondly, He who brought us the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, in order to the Pardon of our Sins, does in that Diſpenſation require our Repentance in order to ſuch our Pardon. Now if Repentance be a Condition of the Pardon, then for that Reaſon alone the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don cannot be Abſolute; becauſe an Abſolute Pardon is an Inconditional Pardon, and it is impoſſible, that the ſame Pardon ſhould be a Conditional, and an Inconditional Pardon too.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An Abſolute Pardon of Sin fights di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt all that we have ſaid under our laſt Head, concerning the Neceſſary Juſtice of Puniſhment: And therefore, till all that be wiped away, we may upon thoſe Grounds deny, that there is any ſuch ſort of Pardon. For, it looks a little too harſh, and that too to Natural Reaſon, to tell us, that God will be reconciled to the Enemy of his Nature, and that upon the account of mere Mercy and Compaſſion; and that, in order to his being ſo, he will throw away all Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Juſtice, which in this Caſe we may adventure to call his Natural Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:49679:34"/>
                     <p n="4">4. If we ſhould ſuppoſe or allow ſuch a thing as an Abſolute Forgiveneſs; then we muſt alſo allow, that it may be the ſame thing, whether a man has been the <hi>beſt,</hi> or the <hi>worſt</hi> Man in the whole World. For an Abſolute Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the Reaſon and Nature of it, may as well be extended to the one, as to the other. For, let what Reaſon ſoever be aſſigned, why it may <hi>not;</hi> and that very Reaſon (be it what it will) will prove the Forgiveneſs not to be <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute.</hi> For, that Forgiveneſs cannot be ſo, that is limited or reſtrained by any Reaſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. An Abſolute Pardon does throw a Slur upon God's Wiſdom, no leſs than it does ſo upon his Juſtice. For, the Law being his, againſt which we have tranſgreſſed, and he having in that very Law threatned Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon ſuch as ſhall tranſgreſs it; if after the Tranſgreſſion he ſhould grant an <hi>abſolute</hi> Pardon to ſuch Tranſgreſſion, he would by <hi>ſuch</hi> a Pardon as much <hi>void</hi> and <hi>annul</hi> the Law, as he had by his <hi>Threatning eſtabliſhed</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> it: And ſo it might come to the ſame paſs, as to the <hi>final</hi> Event, whether he had made any Law or no. For, what is the Difference, not to <hi>make</hi> a Law, and not to <hi>execute</hi> it? And therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blank to our purpoſe tells us, in the Third to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Fifth and Sixth Verſes, That if God ſhould not execute Vengeance, he would not only be unrighteous, but that alſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49679:34"/>he could not judge the World. And we may add, that he would not only be <hi>unrighteous,</hi> but (conſidering the Contrariety that would be between his Practice and his Law) he would be <hi>unwiſe</hi> alſo. And therefore,</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Laſtly, The laſt Judgment, and that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription that we meet with of it in <hi>Gods Word,</hi> do fully aſſure us, that he has no ſuch Deſigns in his Counſels, as to throw away his Laws to gratifie his Enemies with Impunity.</p>
                     <p>From all which Reaſons, and (as we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) from each of them in particular, it ſeems ſatisfactorily evident, that a <hi>Goſpel-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of Sin is no <hi>abſolute</hi> Pardon: And that therefore, when God does in the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Pardon of Sin, there muſt be ſome previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conditions, that muſt be obſerved in order to ſuch a Pardon. And what Share our Saviour has in the Performance and Accompliſhment of ſuch Conditions, we ſhall learn hereafter.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, before we diſmiſs this Chapter, we muſt not diſſemble, that it may be <hi>ſurmiſed,</hi> and therefore alſo, that it may be <hi>objected,</hi> That tho' there ſhould be no <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi> Goſpel-Pardon, that yet there <hi>may</hi> be an <hi>arbitrary</hi> Goſpel-Pardon; and that there are ſome Expreſſions in the New Teſtament, that lean that way, and may at leaſt incline us to believe, that there is ſuch a Thing. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſure, that no Pardon can come from God, but what is juſt; and becauſe we know that Arbitrary <hi>Juſtice</hi> is only one Branch
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49679:35"/>of Arbitrary <hi>Power,</hi> and therefore is in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity no Juſtice at all (for it is only a reſolute Determination of the Will, without any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſuch Determination) therefore we are ſure, that it cannot belong to God. For all his Actions are limited and bounded by his Holineſs, that is, by the Eternal Rules of Reaſon and Juſtice: And he only therefore wills what he pleaſes, becauſe he neither does not can pleaſe to will any thing, but what is Juſt.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving in the Firſt Chapter made it good, that Miſery and Death, that is, in one Word, that Vengeance is, as the <hi>juſt,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>neceſſary</hi> Wages of Sin: And, in the Second, That the Goſpel it ſelf holds out no ſuch thing to us as either an Abſolute or Arbitrary Forgiveneſs of Sin: Our next Propoſition muſt be, <hi>That becauſe the Goſpel
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49679:35"/>in this very</hi> Caſe <hi>is the Revelation of</hi> God's Will, <hi>and becauſe the</hi> Will <hi>and</hi> Counſel <hi>of</hi> God <hi>in that Goſpel revealed is the</hi> Pardon <hi>and</hi> Salvation <hi>of</hi> Man; <hi>that therefore Man's Sin is to be pardoned, tho' not by an</hi> abſolute <hi>or</hi> arbitrary <hi>Forgiveneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then, becauſe it muſt for that Reaſon be pardoned ſome way or other; it will be our next Buſineſs to enquire, what that Way is. For, by ſuch Enquiry it may perhaps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a Goſpel-Truth, and that too agreeable to Reaſon, That <hi>there is not Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other, but in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>alone;</hi> and, that <hi>there is no other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here, becauſe the Goſpel promiſes no <hi>abſolute</hi> Pardon of Sin; as we do from thence in the firſt place conclude, that the Pardon muſt be <hi>conditional;</hi> ſo we muſt in the next place enquire, what that Condition, or what thoſe Conditions are, upon which this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is to be obtained.</p>
                     <p>Now, if in order to our more rational and ſatisfactory Reſolution of this Enquiry, we do firſt look into the Goſpel, there to inform our ſelves, what a Goſpel-Salvation means; we may from thence learn, that it does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it Two Things: Whereof the firſt is, <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin; and the ſecond is, the Gift of <hi>Eternal Happineſs.</hi> And in order to the obtaining of theſe Two Things (as we ſhall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49679:36"/>ſee more fully in the farther Proſecution of this Matter) Two other Things are in the Goſpel required: 1. An <hi>Expiation of Sin;</hi> and, 2. A <hi>Reſtitution to our loſt Holineſs.</hi> For, as we may conclude from our ſecond Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That (tho' the Goſpel does allow a <hi>Pardon,</hi> yet becauſe it does not allow an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi> Pardon of Sin, that) therefore <hi>ſomething</hi> will be required in <hi>order</hi> to ſuch a Pardon: So we may conclude from our firſt Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That (becauſe <hi>Puniſhment</hi> for Sin is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>) therefore <hi>ſome</hi> Puniſhment (be that what it will at preſent) <hi>muſt</hi> be ſuffered for our Sin.</p>
                     <p>And then, if in the Progreſs of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe it ſhall appear, that in Conſideration of any ſuch Puniſhment ſo ſuffered, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Pardon of our Sins does afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; then ſuch Pardon may be ſo far aſcribed to ſuch Puniſhment, as that our Guilt, and the Vengeance due to ſuch our Guilt, may be truly eſteemed to be expiated by it.</p>
                     <p>Now, in order to find out what Puniſhment it is, that <hi>can</hi> make ſuch an Expiation, we ſhall firſt enquire, what Puniſhment <hi>cannot</hi> do it. And becauſe Repentance does not ſo wholly conſiſt in <hi>Action,</hi> but that it muſt have ſomething of <hi>Suffering</hi> mixed with it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in purſuit of our Deſign, let our firſt <hi>Negative</hi> Propoſition be this:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That our <hi>Repentance</hi> for our Sins can never make out an Expiation of our Sins.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49679:36"/>For, tho' Repentance for our Sins be a <hi>Goſpel-Condition</hi> required of us, without which we ſhall never be made Partakers of the Benefit of the <hi>Goſpel-Expiation;</hi> yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, we neither <hi>do,</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance make out <hi>that</hi> Expiation for Sin, which is by the Goſpel <hi>neceſſary</hi> for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For, beſides that there is no Man's Repentance ſo <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> as to free him from <hi>all</hi> Sin, <hi>while</hi> he lives; and ſo after all he muſt remain a Sinner as <hi>long</hi> as he lives: I ſay, beſides that, His very <hi>manner</hi> of going out of the World, and that is by Death, is a demonſtrative Proof, that his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance has <hi>not</hi> made an Expiation for his Sins; becauſe we may moſt certainly conclude, that his Sins are not then <hi>expiated,</hi> and ſo neither <hi>pardoned,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> himſelf lays on the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty threatned in his Law with his <hi>own</hi> Hand. For when God gave his Law to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in their univerſal Father and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative <hi>Adam,</hi> we know, that he <hi>ratified</hi> ſuch Law by the Penalty of Death; and we know alſo, that every Man (let him be as pemtent as can be ſuppoſed) does ſtill <hi>ſuffer</hi> that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. And we may from thence alſo know, that for that Reaſon no Man's Repentance can ſo far expiate his Sin, as to free him from the Puniſhment threatned to it by the Law. And then from the whole we may conclude, That if any Man be ſaved becauſe he is a true Penitent, he muſt be ſaved by ſome
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49679:37"/>
                        <hi>other</hi> Expiation, than by ſuch his <hi>Repentance;</hi> foraſmuch as his Repentance can at the moſt but <hi>qualifie</hi> him to be made a Partaker of ſuch Expiation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As Man's <hi>Repentance</hi> for his Sin (which we may call his <hi>voluntary</hi> Puniſhment for Sin) cannot; ſo neither can his <hi>profeſſed Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (which we may call his <hi>legal</hi> Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Sin) expiate his Sin, and ſo obtain for him a Goſpel-forgiveneſs; and that for this Reaſon, becauſe there is ſuch a Thing in the Goſpel, as an <hi>eternal</hi> Puniſhment, allotted to Sin. And as under the <hi>laſt</hi> Head we found, that Reaſon did fall in with the Goſpel, and that they both ſpake the ſame thing; ſo alſo we ſhall find it <hi>here.</hi> For, it is certain, that the Puniſhment of ſinful Man can therefore never <hi>expiate</hi> his Sin, becauſe it can never purchaſe a juſt <hi>Releaſe</hi> from Puniſhment; and it is certain, that it cannot do <hi>that,</hi> if it may be juſtly continued to <hi>Eternity.</hi> And that it may be ſo, we may learn from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law of <hi>Grace</hi> being God's Law, as well as the Law of <hi>Works,</hi> muſt for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be juſt: And we are aſſured by this Law, as much as Words can aſſure us, that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which it denounces againſt thoſe, who do not ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>l the Conditions of it, is Eternal. And that it ſhall ſo prove, beſides the expreſs Words of the Law, we have this farther Reaſon; which is, that the ſuffering the Puniſhment <hi>threatned</hi> by the Law to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49679:37"/>thoſe, who <hi>neglect</hi> to perform the Conditions of the Law, can neither in Senſe or Reaſon paſs for the <hi>Performance</hi> of ſuch Conditions ſo neglected; and that the Neglect of this Law ſhall (and that in Reaſon and Juſtice) be repaid with an <hi>additional</hi> Vengeance for the <hi>refuſal</hi> of the <hi>Mercy</hi> offered in it, (which deſigns to free us from the Puniſhment of all our other Sins) as well as with <hi>that</hi> Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is <hi>due</hi> to ſuch Sins. For, it is Reaſon and Juſtice, that a more <hi>heinous</hi> Sin ſhould be puniſhed with a more <hi>grievous</hi> Judgment; and it is Truth and Reaſon, that a Sinner does then become a more <hi>heinous</hi> Criminal, when to his <hi>Deſert</hi> of Puniſhment, he adds a <hi>Neglect</hi> or <hi>Contempt</hi> of the eaſie Conditions of Pardon. And ſince by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Covenant of Grace, ſuch Sinner is to ſuffer his Puniſhment after his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Dead, that is, not only after the Time limited for the Poſſibility of his Pardon is expired, but alſo after Death it ſelf ſhall be deſtroyed; as we may from thence conclude the <hi>certainty,</hi> ſo may we alſo the <hi>eternal</hi> Duration of his Puniſhment. For, as a Puniſhment due <hi>after</hi> the Day of Grace is <hi>paſt,</hi> will not be <hi>remitted;</hi> ſo ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when <hi>Death</hi> is no <hi>more,</hi> cannot be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</hi> By which we may underſtand, that as Death is, without a Saviour, the juſt and neceſſary Wages of Sin, (as we made it good in our firſt Chapter) ſo alſo, that when
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49679:38"/>ſuch Death is ſure (by a Reſurrection pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by a Saviour) to be taken away, in order to an happy and everlaſting Life, (and that too upon the <hi>eaſie,</hi> or, at worſt, the very <hi>feaſible</hi> Conditions of the Goſpel;) yet if Men will <hi>neglect</hi> ſuch Salvation, ſo placed within their reach, and ſo leave the eternal Life (purchaſed for them in order to their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) expoſed to the Vengeance, which is the juſt and neceſſary Reward of all their <hi>other</hi> Sins, and of ſuch their <hi>Neglect;</hi> they muſt impute it to their own Folly, if ſuch <hi>Vengeance,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> be the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi> Companion of their eternal Life. For, in the Caſe ſo put, the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> from Death to Life comes from the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God; the making that Life <hi>eternal,</hi> comes from the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God; the Deſigning to make that eternal Life <hi>happy,</hi> comes from the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God; The granting Means to Men (and thoſe no very hard ones neither) of <hi>obtaining</hi> that Happineſs, comes from the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God. But fooliſh Man defeats the Counſel of God, by an obſtinate and unrelenting Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in Sin; and does in <hi>this</hi> Caſe, as he does in <hi>moſt</hi> others, turn the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of <hi>God</hi> into a <hi>Curſe</hi> upon <hi>himſelf;</hi> that is, he makes that Life, which was deſigned for his eternal <hi>Happineſs,</hi> an Occaſion of the eternity of his <hi>Miſery.</hi>

                     <p>One thing more may be added to what has been ſaid upon this Head, and then we ſhall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49679:38"/>apply it to our preſent Deſign; and that is, That at that time, when the Puniſhment we now ſpeak of ſhall come to be inflicted, our Saviour (as the Scriptures tell us) will have laid down his Mediatorial Office, and ſo Men muſt ſtand the Award of their own Deſerts; and then, if ſuch their Deſerts be <hi>Evil,</hi> we may be inſtructed from what was ſaid in the Firſt Chapter, that the Juſtice, which will overtake them, will be Juſtice without Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and that pure and unmix'd Vengeance will be their Portion, even ſuch Vengeance which will only <hi>revenge</hi> upon them the Breach of the Covenants of their God, but will never ſo much as pretend to <hi>make up</hi> ſuch Breach.</p>
                     <p>To our preſent purpoſe then: If the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Men for their own Sins ſhall, without the Interpoſition of a Saviour, be <hi>eternal;</hi> and if this appear to be ſo by the Teſtimony of that very <hi>Goſpel,</hi> (in which, however, there is a Poſſibility of Salvation held forth) and if <hi>Reaſon</hi> do vouch for the Truth of what the Goſpel in this Caſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and laſtly, if an <hi>Eternity</hi> of Puniſhment be abſolutely inconſiſtent with an <hi>Expiation</hi> of Sin by ſuch Puniſhment (for the <hi>laſt</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Sin to be <hi>cancelled,</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi> ſuppoſes it to be <hi>continued):</hi> Then we may conclude, that the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of Man for his Sin can no more exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this our Deſign will ſtill be farthered, if we conſider in the</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourth place, That as neither <hi>Man</hi> for himſelf, nor the Creatures, that are <hi>inferior</hi> to him, can make any Expiation for his Sins; ſo neither can the Creatures <hi>above</hi> him. Now the moſt exalted Creatures that Revelation has acquainted us with (and we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Caſe, but what we have from Revelation) are the Angels and Archangels: And we may be therefore ſatisfied, that thoſe glorious Beings can never make an Expiation for the Sin of <hi>Man;</hi> becauſe it appears by the Revelations of God, that they can never make an Expiation for their <hi>own</hi> Sins. And therefore, as we are told in ſuch Revelations, that <hi>ſome</hi> of them have ſinned; ſo we are in the ſame told, that <hi>thoſe</hi> that <hi>have</hi> ſo done, are <hi>reſerved in everlaſting Chains, to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49679:41"/>of the great Day.</hi> Now, our Natural Reaſon tells us, that no Creature can be ſo in love with Miſery (and ſurely <hi>everlaſting Chains,</hi> and <hi>a fearful expectation of Judgment,</hi> do imply Miſery; for, <hi>the Devils believe and tremble:</hi>) But, I ſay, our Natural Reaſon tells us, that no Creature can be ſo in love with Miſery, as not to free it ſelf from it, were it in its power ſo to do. And therefore the ſame Natural Reaſon does tell us, that the true Reaſon why the faln Angels <hi>do</hi> not do ſo, is becauſe they <hi>cannot</hi> do ſo. And if they cannot expiate their <hi>own</hi> Sins, we may be pretty well ſatisfied, that they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate Sin at <hi>all:</hi> And we may be the rather ſo ſatisfied, becauſe we are as ſure, that they would in the Caſe <hi>employ</hi> their beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for themſelves, as we are ſure, that they <hi>love</hi> themſelves beſt.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we know, that in the Caſe of Mankind, Death is threatned, as the Penalty for the Breach of the Law: And we may be pretty well ſatisfied, that without Death no Expiation can be made: For, <hi>without Blood there is no Remiſſion.</hi> But, on the other ſide, we have ſome Reaſon to believe, that <hi>Angels</hi> are not liable to <hi>Death,</hi> at leaſt, not to <hi>ſuch</hi> a Death, to which <hi>Man</hi> is obnoxious; and therefore, for this Reaſon, as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we may pretty rationally conclude, That the Angels are in no Capacity to expiate the Sins of Mankind, and that therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:49679:41"/>
                     <p>One thing more I would add to this Head, before I leave it; and that is this: That tho' the Angels are very glorious and exalted Creatures, and, by the Account we have of them in the Scriptures, are placed in a much higher Scale in the Creation than Man, and ſo are far above him; yet ſtill, becauſe they are <hi>Creatures,</hi> they are <hi>therefore</hi> at as great a diſtance from <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Man</hi> himſelf is: For, their Diſtance from him is infinite; and there are, we know, no Degrees in Infinity. Now, becauſe the Expiation of Sin is to be made to God, and to God alone; and becauſe there is an infinite Diſtance between God and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> as well as there is between God and <hi>Man:</hi> I ſay, for theſe Reaſons, we can no more think the Interpoſition of an <hi>Angel</hi> effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for making an Atonement and Expiation for Sin, than we can think the Interpoſition of a <hi>Man</hi> to be ſo. And if we ſhould ſuppoſe a <hi>ſort</hi> of Creatures a thouſand, nay, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand or more times as much above <hi>Angels,</hi> as <hi>Angels</hi> are above <hi>Men;</hi> yet becauſe, after ſuch a Suppoſition, even <hi>this</hi> ſort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are as much below God, as <hi>Man</hi> is; and becauſe the Expiation of Sin, if attempted by ſuch Creatures, is to be made to <hi>God;</hi> therefore we cannot think, that the Dignity of their Station can contribute any thing at all towards the making their attempted Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation effectual. And we know, and that too by unqueſtionable Proof, that the Dignity of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49679:42"/>the faln Angels (and among them, one of them <hi>Son of the Morning,</hi> whatever that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies; but we may be ſatisfied, that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſomething excellent) but, I ſay, we know, that the Dignity of the faln Angels did not ſo far avail them, but that God provided and accepted an Expiation for faln Man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he left them in the Hands of Juſtice, to attend the Events of their own Deſerts. So that, for ought we can diſcover, either by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation or Reaſon, the <hi>Dignity</hi> of no <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> whatſoever does <hi>qualifie</hi> him to make an Expiation for thoſe Sins which he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit againſt the <hi>Creator.</hi> For, in this Caſe, the Diſtance between the Party <hi>offended,</hi> and the Party <hi>offending,</hi> being infinite, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be any Mediation or Expiation, that can extend it ſelf to <hi>both</hi> the Extremes. And therefore, we ſhall at laſt, from what has been ſaid upon this Head, conclude, That no Creature, tho' never ſo much above Man, can ever make an Expiation to God for the Sins of Man.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Fifthly, and laſtly: As no <hi>ſinful</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can ever by its Puniſhment expiate its <hi>own</hi> Sins, or the Sins of any <hi>other</hi> Creature; ſo no <hi>innocent</hi> Creature can do the <hi>laſt,</hi> that is, no <hi>innocent</hi> Creature can ever expiate the Sins of any <hi>ſinful</hi> Creature. For, in ſuch a Caſe, it muſt, in order to its <hi>undergoing</hi> the <hi>Puniſhment juſtly,</hi> firſt <hi>take</hi> upon it the <hi>Sin willingly;</hi> and ſo, by putting it ſelf into the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49679:42"/>Place of the Sinner, muſt firſt be ſuppoſed to be ſuch a Sinner it ſelf, before it can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the Puniſhment due to its Sin. But then, when any Creature is ſuppoſed to lie under the Burden of ſuch Sin, it is at the ſame time ſuppoſed to be in the <hi>ſame</hi> Condition with the <hi>Original</hi> Sinner himſelf: For, when the Puniſhment comes to be transferr'd from the laſt to the firſt, it is therefore ſo transferr'd, becauſe the Law allows the Act of the Surety, by which he has owned and accepted the Sin to be his own: And then the Law in ſuch a Caſe makes no difference between the <hi>Surety</hi> and the <hi>Principal.</hi> And if the <hi>Law makes</hi> no difference, then, as to the Buſineſs of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may be therefore ſure, that there <hi>is none,</hi> becauſe both are <hi>Creatures,</hi> and both are <hi>Sinners.</hi> If therefore (as we ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the <hi>Principal</hi> could not by his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (had he undergone it himſelf) have expiated his Guilt; then, for the ſelf-ſame Reaſons, the <hi>Surety</hi> will alſo be unable to expiate the ſelf-ſame Guilt. So that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this Head will be, that as no <hi>ſinful</hi> Creature is able to unload its ſelf of its Sin by its Puniſhment; ſo no Creature (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo <hi>innocent</hi>) will be able to do it, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed for its Fellow-Creature. And therefore, as we do not know, that any of the Bleſſed Angels, who <hi>retained</hi> their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, did ever interpoſe for the Redemption of thoſe that <hi>fell,</hi> ſo we do moſt aſſuredly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49679:43"/>know, that tho' they did interpoſe, the Event did not anſwer; becauſe we know, that the Condition of thoſe that fell, does continue deſperate: Nay, there do not want probable Reaſons to perſuade, that the faln Angels <hi>themſelves</hi> do not interpoſe for their <hi>own</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in any kind, no not ſo much as by <hi>Prayer:</hi> Which, if it be true; as it is a good Argument of their Deſpair, ſo it is a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument, that they have no Mediator, in whoſe Name they may put up ſuch their Prayers, and for whoſe ſake they may with any probability hope, that they will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. And yet all this while we have no Reaſon to doubt, but that That noble Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which muſt needs accompany a perfect and unſpotted Innocence (ſuch as that of the Holy Angels is) would be inclined to engage it ſelf one way or other for the Redemption of their faln Brethren, did not their Prudence check and controul ſuch a poſſible Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And then, if ſuch their Prudence do not conſiſt in One of theſe Two Things, that is, that they either think or know, that ſuch their Interpoſition would be either <hi>ſawcie</hi> or <hi>vain;</hi> we can hardly upon any other ground excuſe their Neglect of ſuch their Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                     <p>In One Word; The Scriptures have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us, that ſome of the Angels have ſinned, and that their Condition thereupon is become deſperate: But the Scriptures have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49679:43"/>not acquainted us, that they have any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to intercede with God in their behalf, or to make Expiation for their Sin. And, as we may be ſatisfied, that were an Expiation <hi>made,</hi> their Sin muſt in Juſtice be <hi>remitted;</hi> ſo may we, that if any of the good Angels had taken upon himſelf to make ſuch <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he muſt, in order to his ſo doing, have taken upon himſelf the <hi>Sin;</hi> and ſo he muſt have brought himſelf into the very ſame Condition with thoſe that fell; and that therefore he would have been juſt as unable as they, to free himſelf from ſuch Condition. No! no! We <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> know well enough, that Sin has Weight enough in it to cruſh both Men and Angels. <hi>Experience</hi> has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us with the <hi>firſt;</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> has aſſured us of <hi>both.</hi> And then the Concluſion is eaſie; That <hi>he</hi> who in ſuch a Caſe could relieve <hi>either,</hi> muſt for that Reaſon be <hi>more powerful</hi> than <hi>both.</hi> And when we come to make it out, that he who <hi>did</hi> ſo, <hi>was</hi> ſo, we ſhall then begin more plainly to perceive, that <hi>there is not Salvation in any other;</hi> tho' moſt of what we have hitherto offered, has directly tended to the ſame Deſign.</p>
                     <p>But before we proceed any farther, we ſhall make ſome few Remarks upon what has been already laid down, that may have an Induence upon our Practice.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, From what has been offered, we may take notice of the great Malignity
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49679:44"/>of Sin. For People <hi>would</hi> hardly <hi>ſin</hi> ſo <hi>freely,</hi> if they <hi>thought Sin</hi> ſo <hi>deadly.</hi> And yet a little Reflection will tell us, that Sin has ſlain all Mankind from the time of <hi>Adam</hi> to the time of the Expiration of the laſt Man that died. We may think the Plague, the Sword, the Famine, great Deſtroyers: They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Beeſoms of Deſtruction,</hi> and, where they come, make great Devaſtations among Mankind; but when we have taken a View of the Deſolations cauſed by them, and by all other Miſeries and Miſchiefs beſides, we muſt know, that as Sin has been the Parent of them all, ſo has it been alſo of all thoſe Calamities and Deſtructions, that all of them have produced: And becauſe it has ſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we take notice in the</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Second place, That God's Juſtice is no ſuch trifling Thing, as is but too generally thought. For, there is no <hi>Sinner,</hi> who ever eſcaped being a <hi>Sufferer.</hi> For, if all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which we ſuffer in this World (and thoſe are neither few, nor light) do come from our Sins, as moſt certainly they do; then we may be eaſily ſatisfied, that even thoſe Sinners, whom yet God does treat with the greateſt Kindneſs of all others, do yet never go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Marks of his Diſpleaſure. And if he does <hi>correct</hi> his <hi>Children</hi> with <hi>Rods</hi> (and we may be ſure, that he never does that, but he does it with <hi>Juſtice</hi> too) then, for the ſame Reaſon, we may believe, that he will <hi>chaſtiſe</hi>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49679:44"/>his <hi>Enemies</hi> with <hi>Scorpions.</hi> And upon this Account we ſhould take care <hi>to hear the Rod, and who has appointed it;</hi> and ſhould make ſuch good uſe of the Miſeries which we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in <hi>this</hi> World, as to let them put us in mind to flee from the Wrath to <hi>come.</hi> For, if we will not <hi>hearken</hi> to God's <hi>Voice,</hi> when he <hi>chides</hi> us, we ſhall at laſt, when he comes to <hi>ſmite</hi> us, <hi>ſink</hi> under the <hi>weight</hi> of his Hand; and if we neglect his <hi>Diſpleaſure,</hi> we ſhall fall under his <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Indignation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If God in the greateſt and higheſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Mercy, with which he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us in his Goſpel, has not allowed us an Abſolute Pardon; but has even in that his Covenant of Grace required Conditions of us, in order to our being made Partakers of that Pardon, which is the Purchaſe of our Saviour; then it does highly concern us, that we take care to perform the Conditions on our Part, that ſo we be not excluded from the Benefits of ſuch Purchaſe. For, tho' it be moſt certain, that we ſhall not be ſaved by our Repentance <hi>alone;</hi> yet it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that we ſhall not be ſaved <hi>without</hi> it. No! He who has purchaſed our Ranſom, has in ſuch his Purchaſe provided for <hi>God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> as well as for <hi>our Safety;</hi> and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Purchaſe, has taught us, that we ſhall <hi>forfeit</hi> the <hi>laſt,</hi> if we take <hi>no care</hi> of the <hi>firſt.</hi> Let us therefore look upon our ſelves, as we are in our ſelves, that is, as forlorn,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49679:45"/>miſerable Wretches: Let us acknowledge our ſelves ſuch to God: Let us quit our Sins, which have made us ſuch: And (as we have by ſuch our Sins hitherto rebelled againſt him) let us for the future reſolve to comply with his Will, that is, to the uttermoſt of our Power, to obey his Laws: Let us be heartily ſorry, that we have been ſo fooliſh, as ever to have done otherwiſe. And when we have done all this, then let us <hi>joyfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> and <hi>thankfully acknowledge</hi> the Deſigns of his Pity towards us, and the Proviſions that he has made for our Safety in a Saviour. For, this is the Way to bring that Salvation, which he has pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ded for Mankind, I ſay, to bring it home to our ſelves, and to make it our own. And I may add, that this is the only way for us to do ſo: For, as <hi>there is not Salvation in any other, but in Jeſus Chriſt alone;</hi> ſo there is not any poſſible Way for us to make our ſelves Partakers of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by Repentance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Becauſe we have ſeen, that the Condition of the faln Angels is forlorn and deſperate, for want of a Saviour to expiate their Sins; therefore this Conſideration ſhould enhance and magnifie our Praiſe to God, that whereas he has in his Severity paſſed by thoſe glorious and exalted Creatures, and ſo has left them to the Stroke of pure and unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice; yet he has not dealt ſo with us Men, weak and ſinful Duſt and Aſhes. <hi>Lord,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49679:45"/>what is Man, that thou art thus mindful of him? or the Son of Man, that thou ſo regardeſt him?</hi> Therefore, <hi>Bleſſing, and Praiſe, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Glory, be to him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.</hi>

                     <p>HAving ſeen in the foregoing Chapter, that an Expiation for our Sin could neither be made by <hi>our ſelves,</hi> nor by any <hi>other</hi> Creature; and that therefore <hi>he,</hi> who could make good ſuch an Expiation, muſt be <hi>more</hi> than a <hi>mere</hi> Creature: It will be our next Buſineſs to ſearch the Scriptures, in which (as we ſhall ſee more fully hereafter) the Expiation of Sin is ſet forth; and there to ſee, what Character they give of him, who made ſuch Expiation: For, by that Means only, we are likely to come to any

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49679:46"/>here, becauſe it is not our profeſſed Buſineſs at preſent: For we have only mentioned it, and confirmed it with ſome few Texts of Scripture, without quoting the Places, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our full and clear Explication of that Expiation which was made by our Saviour. And when we come to do <hi>that,</hi> we ſhall <hi>then</hi> more plainly perceive, that the <hi>Deity</hi> of our Saviour, and the <hi>Expiation</hi> made by him, do mutually prove and eſtabliſh each other.</p>

The Scriptures do acquaint us, That that very Perſon to whom they do aſcribe the Expiation of Sin, was a <hi>true and real Man.</hi> For they give us an Account of his <hi>Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Nativity, Life,</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> They acquaint us with his <hi>Converſation,</hi> and <hi>Manner of Life;</hi> with his <hi>Natural Actions and Paſſions;</hi> and each of them <hi>ſuch,</hi> which are undoubted <hi>Arguments</hi> of an <hi>Humane</hi> Nature and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Such are his <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> his <hi>Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Grieving,</hi> and the like: By which Account of his Perſon, we may be as well ſatisfied of his <hi>Humanity</hi> under <hi>this</hi> Head, as we may be of his <hi>Deity</hi> under the <hi>laſt.</hi> And I may add, that (if we do with Simplicity and Sincerity receive the Account of his Perſon and Character, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give us both in the <hi>one</hi> Caſe and in the <hi>other</hi>) that we may be as well ſatisfied of his <hi>Deity</hi> under the <hi>laſt</hi> Head, as of his <hi>Humanity</hi> under <hi>this.</hi> But neither ſhall I at preſent purſue this Thing any further, becauſe I muſt

                        </gap> our Saviour be God Incarnate, there can be no doubt, but that he is God and Man) and becauſe our true underſtanding of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Expiation, does mightily depend upon the Doctrine of the Incarnation; and becauſe, laſtly, this Doctrine of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not only vigorouſly <hi>oppoſed</hi> by many among us, but alſo <hi>ſlighted,</hi> and even <hi>ridicul'd</hi> by <hi>not</hi> a <hi>few;</hi> therefore we muſt a while
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49679:47"/>make a Stand here, and examine, whether the Incarnation (which we affirm to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Scriptures) will not ſtand the Teſt, and admit the <hi>Approbation</hi> of Reaſon; or whether (as is pretended) it be ſo abſurd, as to be eaſily <hi>confuted</hi> by Reaſon, or to be treated with <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Deriſion.</hi>

                     <p>And, in the firſt place, we cannot but take notice, that as Contempt and Deriſion is very <hi>ſeldom</hi> a Sign of Wiſdom; ſo it is ſo far from being ſo, when it is imployed about any thing which does appear to be the Revelation of <hi>God,</hi> that, in ſuch a Caſe, we may certainly pronounce it to be <hi>Folly.</hi> For, let it (for once) be ſuppoſed, that ſome Men (and yet thoſe ſome have been very far the greater Number of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> through all Ages, ſince the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was recorded for the Word of God.)

                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49679:48"/>Now this Conſideration we have therefore offered in the firſt place, to check the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe, who lean ſo much to their own Underſtandings, that they will never allow Revelation to guide their Reaſon; but, on the contrary, do ſo manage it by their uncouth Expoſitions, as to permit it to ſpeak no Truth, but what their Natural Reaſon might have acquainted them with, without it.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed: To ſuch Men, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>reject</hi> the <hi>Belief,</hi> becauſe they <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of the Incarnation, I would put this ſhort Queſtion, which is, Whether or no they are acquainted with the Nature of all poſſible Unions? For, it is moſt certain, that the Reach of no Man's Underſtanding is ſo large, as to enable him where to <hi>fix</hi> the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>Bounds</hi> of all ſuch Unions, nor yet to account for the <hi>Manner</hi> how ſeveral of thoſe Unions, with which yet it is acquainted, are made. And Inſtances might be given (and thoſe too not a few) to make out what we have ſaid. But tho' Humane Underſtanding is not <hi>acquainted</hi> with <hi>all poſſible</hi> Unions; nor can <hi>account</hi> for <hi>many,</hi> with which yet it <hi>is</hi> acquainted; yet that will be no good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that therefore there are no ſuch Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Alas! our moſt refined and improved Reaſon falls ſhort in its Knowledge of the greateſt part of thoſe Things, which yet are as ſurely known, as it is ſure, that there is ſuch a Thing as Omniſcience, and ſuch a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49679:49"/>Being as a God. And when we are once ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that any Union, be it what it will, is revealed to us by Omniſcience; as we may by the ſame Means be ſatisfied in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that there <hi>really is</hi> ſuch an Union; ſo we may be ſatisfied in Modeſty, that the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Diſcovery</hi> of ſuch Union did <hi>exceed</hi> the Graſp of our Natural Underſtanding. Tho' therefore, in what follows, I do neither pretend to prove or to explain the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Reaſon; yet if any Thing ſhall be offered, by which the Expreſſions which the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> gives us of it, ſhall appear to be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>literal,</hi> and that their Meaning <hi>is,</hi> what it <hi>ſeems</hi> to be; it will be a ſufficient Ground for our Belief of the Thing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe with whom we have to do in the preſent Argument, do not pretend to doubt the <hi>Truth,</hi> but only the <hi>Meaning</hi> of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In order then to the helping forward our Faith in the Union of God and Man in the Incarnation of our Saviour; I would offer it to Conſideration, That the Scriptures do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, that there is a very intimate Union between Chriſt and his Church. And tho' Humane and <hi>unaſſiſted</hi> Reaſon, taking its Meaſures from other Inſtances of the like Appearances, may be apt to conclude, that the Union of our Saviour with his Church is but a Political Union, ſuch as is between a King and his Subjects, or the Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49679:49"/>of an ordinary Corporation; yet a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>'s Reaſon, once truly enlightned, and ſo guided by Divine Revelation, will thereupon conclude it to be ſomething nobler and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And becauſe it is informed, that he took part of the ſame Fleſh and Blood with his Members, and becauſe he their Head does influence ſuch his Members by his Spirit, in order to their Spiritual Life; that therefore there is between them, in ſome ſenſe, a <hi>vital</hi> Union.</p>
                     <p>From whence we may, to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, conclude, That one Perſon may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally united to another, and that too at the greateſt apparent Diſtances; and that they may by that means become one, tho' our Senſes, and our Natural, but unaſſiſted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, do give us in quite contrary Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſent a great Hoſt, and encloſed <hi>Eliſha</hi> in <hi>Dothan,</hi> in order to his Deſtruction, the Man of God, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his deſponding Servant, deſired of the Lord to open his Eyes: and when that was done, he ſaw the Mountain full of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Chariots of Fire round about his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Now tho' one might well think (and Natural Reaſon would be apt to incline one more than barely to think ſo) that Fire is a Thing very diſcoverable to our Sight; (for perhaps nothing diſcovers it ſelf to our Sight but Fire) yet we ſee, that ſometimes Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is required even for ſuch a Diſcovery.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49679:50"/>But then, ſuch a Revelation, when once made, does eaſily work a Conviction. And truly I cannot perſuade my ſelf, but that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of our Saviour's Union with his Church would do ſo too, would Chriſtians but conſider it with an honeſt and ſincere Mind, and with a free and impartial Reaſon. For, tho' I am ſatisfied, that <hi>bare</hi> Reaſon could not have <hi>diſcovered</hi> it; yet I cannot ſo well ſatisfie my ſelf, that a <hi>diligent Uſe</hi> of our Reaſon will then let us <hi>diſſent</hi> from it, when once Revelation has <hi>acquainted</hi> us with it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But, ſecondly, I would have it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in order to the Aſſiſting our Belief of the Union of God with Man in the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour, whether or no the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> of the poſſible Union of God with Man be not (at leaſt in ſome degree) <hi>natural.</hi> For, that the Heathen in many Countries, and in ſeveral Ages, had ſuch a Notion, (and that too very ordinary and common) might be made out from innumerable Inſtances out of their ſeveral Hiſtories. But it will be the leſs needful to produce any from thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are furniſhed with one out of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles:</hi> For there, in the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, where we have an Account, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> cured the impotent Man who had been a Creeple from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, we are likewiſe told, that <hi>the People lift up their Voices, and ſaid,</hi> that <hi>the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49679:50"/>Gods are come down to us in the likeneſs of Men.</hi> And that we may not think, that ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions proceeded only from an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Notion of the Deity, we may furniſh our ſelves with Inſtances in abundance from the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that the Worſhippers of the true God had conſtantly the ſame Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions: For, tho' God ſometimes appeared to the <hi>Jews</hi> in Fire, as to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh; and ſometimes in a Cloud, as in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; and ſometimes in both together, as in the Wilderneſs, and in Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> Yet his more conſtant and repeated Appearances to particular Perſons, were in the Likeneſs of Man. So he appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to <hi>Manoah,</hi> and to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others. And tho' it be freely confeſſed, that ſome of thoſe Appearances were in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity but the Appearances of <hi>Angels;</hi> yet it muſt be granted alſo, that ſuch Angels were ſo united to thoſe Bodies, in which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that they did in them exerciſe ſeveral Actions both of an Humane and Animal Life. By which we may be inſtructed, that an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> may be ſo united to <hi>Man,</hi> that our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that may help to lead us one Step farther towards our Belief, that <hi>Man</hi> may be united to <hi>God.</hi> It muſt be granted alſo, that tho' in ſeveral of the Inſtances laid down, the <hi>Union</hi> was only between a <hi>Man</hi> and an <hi>Angel;</hi> yet (which is cloſe to our preſent purpoſe) <hi>they</hi> who <hi>ſaw</hi> the Appearance, did
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49679:51"/>almoſt conſtantly <hi>take</hi> it for the Appearance of <hi>God.</hi> So it ſeems to be in the Caſe of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in the Fifth Chapter of that Book: So it was in the Caſe of <hi>Manoah</hi> and his Wife, in the Thirteenth Chapter of <hi>Judges,</hi> where the Man tells his Wife, <hi>We ſhall certainly die, becauſe we have ſeen God:</hi> And ſo undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly it was in the Caſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he entertained the Three Men, in the Eighteenth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> for <hi>Abraham</hi> in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and Diſcourſe treats one of them as the Lord God himſelf; and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Twenty fifth Verſe, calls him, <hi>the Judge of all the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To our purpoſe then; If it be certain, that Angels have appeared to Men in Humane Shape; If it be certain, that under ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances they have done ſeveral Actions of the Humane Life, ſuch as Talking, Walking, Eating, Drinking, and the like; if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that God himſelf has ſo appeared, and under ſuch Appearances has alſo done the ſame Things; And, laſtly, if it be certain, that moſt of thoſe People, to whom ſuch Appearances have been made, have conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken ſuch Appearances for the Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in the Likeneſs of Man: I ſay, if theſe Things be ſo, as it is probable, by what has been ſaid in ſhort, that ſo they are; then, as we may rationally look upon ſuch Things as Preſigurations of the Incarnation; ſo may we alſo be ſo far from <hi>thinking</hi> the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49679:51"/>Incarnation an <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> or an Impoſſibility, that we may be ſatisfied, that <hi>great, good,</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> Men have <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>thought otherwiſe,</hi> and that too upon ſuch their <hi>own</hi> Experience; to which they, who deny an Incarnation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>do</hi> nor <hi>muſt</hi> pretend, unleſs they will by ſuch their Pretences contradict themſelves. Now, if <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had ſuch an intimate Converſe with God, and ſo was a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judge in the Caſe, than we can pretend to be, did not only acknowledge the <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> but the <hi>Reality</hi> of an Incarnation too, it may ſo much the leſs become us to deny it; and that too the rather, becauſe we may eaſily ſatisfie our ſelves, that <hi>he</hi> did ſo believe. And therefore I do not queſtion, but that there is more in that Saying of our Saviour, than is uſually taken to be, <hi>[Your Father Abraham rejoiced to ſee my Day, and he ſaw it, and was glad.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. I would take notice, in the third Place, That where the Scriptures do profeſſedly give us the Account of Man's Creation, they do frequently inculcate it upon us, that God made Man after his own Image and Likeneſs; I ſay, frequently, becauſe I find it ſo deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Six times in the Beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and in Two Places, that is, both in the Twenty ſixth and Twenty ſeventh Verſes of the Firſt Chapter, with an Ingemination: And an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemination does by the very way of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſummon us to a more deliberate <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49679:52"/>to,</hi> and <hi>obſervation of</hi> what is ſpoken. Now tho' we do not, with the <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites,</hi> from ſuch repeated Expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God has the Shape and Figure, or the Image and Likeneſs of a Man; yet for all that, it will be impoſſible to conceive any Senſe in the Words, if <hi>God</hi> may not be ſo <hi>like</hi> to Man, as <hi>Man</hi> is like to <hi>God:</hi> For the Likeneſs with reference to both muſt be the ſame (be that Likeneſs at preſent what it will) or elſe there can be no Likeneſs at all. And to ſay, that the Likeneſs conſiſts in Holineſs, is too frigid an Interpretation of ſuch an inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reiterated Expreſſion, and does not very well agree with ſeveral Texts, where ſuch Likeneſs is mentioned; nor indeed does it ſeem to come up to the Import of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. And I am therefore perſuaded, that the Patriarchs apprehended, that there was ſomething more in it, for the Reaſons offered under the laſt Head. For, tho' <hi>Moſes,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of the Creation, lived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; yet it is not only poſſible, but alſo highly probable, that their Notion of the Thing might be derived down by Tradition from <hi>them</hi> to <hi>him:</hi> And we may be the rather ſatisfied, that ſo it was, becauſe after the Flood, God does give it as a Reaſon to <hi>Noah,</hi> why that Man's blood ſhall be ſhed by Man, who ſheds Mans Blood, becauſe <hi>God made Man in his own Image.</hi> Now, (conſidering the Longevity of Men in thoſe Days) as a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49679:52"/>Tradition from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo a Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> is a very conceivable Thing, eſpecially in ſuch a Caſe, in which ſeveral of the intermediate Deſcendants might reaſonably conceive, that they had had, at leaſt, ſomething like Experience in the Caſe, by converſing with God in the Likeneſs of Man.</p>
                     <p>To come up a little cloſer to that Point, at which we all this while do aim: As the Derivation of all Mankind from one ſole Head and Fountain, which was the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> was a Type, that all the Elect ſhould by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation derive from one ſole Fountain, which was the <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi> and as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpent's Head,</hi> contained in it a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Account of the Manner of the Saviour's Nativity: So the Expreſſion of <hi>Man's being made after God's Image and Likeneſs,</hi> does to me ſeem to be a Proleptick Declaration of the Incarnation, and, when compared with ſeveral Places in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> may very fairly, at this time of day, be thought to be no very dark Prophecy, that God ſhould be made in the Likeneſs of Man. For, if it were in the Counſel and Foreknowledge of God, that God ſhould become Man, and be really united to an Humane Body; then the Expreſſion, that <hi>Man was made in the Image and Likeneſs of God,</hi> will, upon that account, not only be <hi>warrantable,</hi> but <hi>proper.</hi> For,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49679:53"/>when God made <hi>Adam,</hi> he made him (if I may ſo ſpeak) by the Samplar in his own Mind: And I may the rather be allowed ſo to ſpeak, becauſe in the very Making of him God does ſeem to ſet himſelf a Pattern, when he ſays, <hi>Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeneſs.</hi> And therefore before <hi>Man</hi> was made at <hi>all,</hi> and before our <hi>Saviour</hi> was made <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Expreſſion</hi> of <hi>Making Man after our Likeneſs, and in our Image,</hi> may be thought only to give an <hi>honorary</hi> Precedence to our Saviour's <hi>Incarnation,</hi> though the <hi>Creation</hi> of Man was to have a <hi>temporary</hi> Precedence to the ſame Incarnation. And then the Import of the Expreſſion, <hi>[Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeneſs]</hi> will amount to thus much; Let us make Man in that Image, and according to that Likeneſs, in which we our ſelf in the Fulneſs of Time will converſe among Men. And therefore, as <hi>Man</hi> in his <hi>Creation</hi> is ſaid to be made in the Likeneſs of <hi>God;</hi> ſo <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Incarnation</hi> is ſaid to be made in the Likeneſs of <hi>Man:</hi> So we read of <hi>God's ſending his Son in the</hi> Likeneſs <hi>of ſinful Fleſh,</hi> in the Third Verſe of the Eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and ſo again, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the Fifth, Sixth, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and Eighth Verſes, the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus being in the Form of God, thought it no Robbery to be Equal with God, and was made in the</hi> Likeneſs <hi>of Man;</hi> that is, in the ſame Apoſtle's Words, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49679:53"/>laſt Verſe, <hi>God was manifeſted in the Fleſh.</hi> And he who ſhall conſider what Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Apoſtle, in the Second to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> and the Sixth Verſe, puts upon the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Verſes of the Eighth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and what Relation thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have to the Twenty ſixth and Twenty eighth Verſes of the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> may be eaſily ſatisfied, that the Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> did prefigure our Saviour's Incarnation. And therefore it is remarkable to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, what we meet with in the Twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Verſe of the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that it is there twice ſaid, that God created <hi>Man</hi> in his own <hi>Image;</hi> but when the Text goes on to ſpeak both of the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Woman,</hi> it is barely ſaid, that God <hi>created</hi> them. Agreeable to which, we may add what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, in the Firſt to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> the Eleventh Chapter and Seventh Verſe, where he tells us, That <hi>the</hi> Man <hi>is both the</hi> Image <hi>and Glory of God;</hi> but then ſpeaking of the <hi>Woman,</hi> he only ſays, that <hi>ſhe is the</hi> Glory <hi>of the Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now from the whole we argue, That <hi>God,</hi> in whoſe Image and Likeneſs <hi>Man</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>was</hi> made in the <hi>Likeneſs</hi> and Faſhion of ſuch created <hi>Man;</hi> that is, that God, who at firſt created Man, was afterwards made in the ſame Likeneſs himſelf; which, in other Words, is the ſame as, He became Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Now there neither is, nor can be any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49679:54"/>doubt, but that That God, who became Man, was the Word of God alſo. Now then, if <hi>God</hi> made <hi>Man,</hi> and if the <hi>Word</hi> of God made <hi>Man;</hi> and if <hi>God was</hi> made Man, and if the <hi>Word</hi> was made Fleſh, that is, <hi>Man:</hi> Then we muſt firſt controul, not only the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Creation</hi> given in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but the Account of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> too; that is, we muſt in effect contradict the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> before we can deny the Union of God with Man, that is before we can deny the Incarnation.</p>
                     <p>We might to all this add thoſe ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> which aſcribe to God the Parts of an Humane Body, ſuch as Eyes, Ears, Noſtrils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Humane Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, Actions, Paſſions, and the like: Which (tho' they are uſually taken to be nothing more but condeſcending Expreſſions, ſuited to our feeble Capacities) yet, from what has been ſaid, may be conceived to carry in them a farther, and more myſterious Meaning, that is, to have a Regard to the Incarnation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> And that too ſo much the rather, becauſe (as Learned Men have obſerved) it is probable, that ſince the Fall God has had no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with Mankind, but by the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Mediator. And then, if ſuch Expreſſions are to be applied to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, (tho' they do not expreſly <hi>foretell</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) yet they may be thought to <hi>inſinuate</hi> a future Incarnation.</p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49679:54"/>
                     <p>To ſum up all then in a few Words: As it is a Preſumption to meaſure all <hi>Poſſibilities</hi> by the Standard of our own Reaſon; ſo is it, to meaſure all poſſible <hi>Unions</hi> by the ſame Line: For there are actually ſeveral real Unions, which muſt be confeſſed to be ſo, which yet we ſhould never have known, if we had not been made acquainted with them by Revelation. And where Divine Revelation (and that too acknowledged by us for ſuch) does in as plain Words as can poſſibly be made uſe of, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us the Perſonal Union of God and Man; and when it does moreover, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gradations, gently lead us (if our Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or Conceitedneſs do not make us hang back) I ſay, when the Revelations of God do gently lead us into ſuch a Belief, how dare our ſhort-ſighted Reaſon <hi>contradict</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> or <hi>limit</hi> the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence?</hi> Do not we know, that <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our being?</hi> and that if he were not preſent with us, we could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think, nor reaſon, nor perform any the ordinary Actions or Offices of Life? And do we think his Power ſo reſtrained, that he cannot, when the Purpoſes of his inſinite Mercy and Goodneſs invite him to it, I ſay, do we think, that he cannot more intimately unite himſelf to any of us, than he has done in the more familiar and ordinary Ways? We believe, that he will do ſo in another World; and it muſt be ſomething very far
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49679:55"/>out of our reach, which <hi>neither Eye hath ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can enter into the Heart of Man to conceive.</hi> And yet we need not at all queſtion, but that God can make a more intimate Union between himſelf and Man, than what will be requir'd to our deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Happineſs: And therefore, when he tells us, that he <hi>has</hi> done ſo, it would be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for us to reſign our ſhallow Reaſon, and to take his Word.</p>
                     <p>One Remark I would leave here, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> leave off this Head; and that is, That tho in the Inſtances produced it has appeared, that <hi>Angels often,</hi> and that (at leaſt probably) <hi>God ſometimes</hi> has appeared to Men in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies; and that they have in ſuch Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies exerciſed ſeveral Functions of an Humane Life and Nature; and that therefore they were ſo united to ſuch Bodies, that, to the Apprehenſions of the Beholders, they were judged to be an Union of God and Man; yet we do not all this while either aſſert, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to maintain, that thoſe Unions were ſuch, or ſo intimate, as that which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to us in the Incarnation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. For, we have not offered the ſeveral Inſtances of Divine Appearances to <hi>explain</hi> the <hi>Manner</hi> how the Union is made, but only to <hi>facilitate</hi> the <hi>Credibility</hi> of it. For, if we are once <hi>ſatisfied</hi> of the <hi>laſt,</hi> it is no great matter, tho' we are <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>firſt.</hi> For, a <hi>reaſonable</hi> Belief of the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of the

It is better in ſuch Caſes to be modeſt and wiſe; and truly we ſhall therefore <hi>approve</hi> our ſelves <hi>wiſe,</hi> if we <hi>keep</hi> our ſelves <hi>modeſt.</hi> Alas! we know not how any one Effect in Nature is produced, tho' ſuch Things lie expoſed to our narroweſt Search and Diſquiſition. And if we are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Methods of God's Working in theſe ordinary and obvious Things, with which we daily converſe, why ſhould we pretend to trace him in his deeper and more myſterious Counſels; in ſuch Things, which he has cover'd with a thicker Veil; Things, that are hid from Principalities and Powers, and ſuch as the Angels themſelves deſire to look into? In ſuch Caſes then it is well enough with us, if we have ſufficient <hi>Ground</hi> for our <hi>Faith,</hi> tho' we can diſcover <hi>nothing</hi> to <hi>gratifie</hi> our <hi>Curioſity.</hi> And our Faith in ſuch Truths muſt then be ſtronger, and more firm, when we have not only the expreſs and plain Word

                     <p>In our Proſecution of the Firſt of which Things, I would deſire all Chriſtians ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider, that they ought the more heartily and devoutly to praiſe God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that he was pleaſed to take upon him our Fleſh, in order to our Redemption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Condition, by reaſon of our Sins, was ſo deſperate and forlorn, that neither our own Repentance, nor our own Puniſhment, no nor the Puniſhment or Interpoſition of the Angels, could ever have redeemed us from that Curſe, which we, by ſuch our Sins, had brought upon our ſelves. For, as for our ſelves, it is moſt certain, that we are leſs able to <hi>return</hi> to our Innocence, after we have <hi>ſinned,</hi> than we were to <hi>retain</hi> our Innocence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49679:57"/>before we had <hi>loſt</hi> it. For, every Sin (as our ſad Experience may eaſily inform us) weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens our Ability to reſiſt Sin; and it is far more eaſie to <hi>preſerve</hi> our Innocence, than to <hi>reſtore</hi> it: And then, when our <hi>Ability</hi> is made <hi>weaker,</hi> and our <hi>Buſineſs</hi> is become <hi>greater,</hi> we may eaſily judge, that ſuch our Buſineſs is very likely to go undone. For which Reaſon, as well as for ſeveral others, formerly mentioned, we may be ſure, that when we had once brought our ſelves into a ſinful, and, for that Reaſon, into a miſerable Condition; we had, by the ſame Means, put it out of our Power to redeem our ſelves from ſuch Sin, and from ſuch Miſery. And it is as certain, that no Man ever was or will be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Condition of the faln Angels diſcovered to us by <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> aſſures us, that there is no Poſſibility for them to do ſuch a Kindneſs for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> and then <hi>Reaſon</hi> will tell us, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they do it for <hi>Man.</hi> Herein then was the Love of our Saviour manifeſted, and mightily inhanced, that he was pleaſed to ſtep in for our Reſcue, when we can diſcover
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49679:57"/>no other Way for our Eſcape. And, if there be not Salvation in any other, then we may be ſure, that our greateſt Praiſe and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments are due to him, who alone <hi>could</hi> bring us Salvation, and who alone <hi>has</hi> brought it; and ſo has not refuſed us that Mercy, which he alone was qualified to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ought to magnifie and praiſe our Saviour, not only becauſe he was pleaſed to <hi>undertake</hi> our Redemption, when he alone could make good ſuch an Undertaking; but that alſo, to make ſuch his Undertaking good, he was pleaſed to take upon him our <hi>Nature,</hi> and to come down to us in that Nature. The Condeſcenſion of the Mercy ought to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Praiſe in our Mouths, and in our Hearts too; and with Aſtoniſhment, and an humble Adoration, we may well cry out with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Lord, what is Man, that thou art thus mindful of him? or the Son of Man, that thou ſo regardeſt him?</hi> We know well enough, that God does every day ſtoop to the Relief of our Neceſſities: His Eye goes through the World, and all Things are under his Inſpection and Care; and he, who feedeth the young Ravens, that call upon him, and cloaths the very Graſs of the Field with Ornament and Beauty, does alſo provide for the Support and Welfare of him, who is made after his own Image. But then this is the Care of his <hi>ordinary</hi> Providence: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. We ought to praiſe God our Saviour, as that for our Redemption he was pleaſed to condeſcend to our Condition, by being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with our Fleſh; ſo alſo, in that by being ſo clothed, he <hi>paſſed</hi> the <hi>faln Angels,</hi> and took not <hi>their</hi> Nature upon him. It is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark made by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>he took not on him the</hi> Nature <hi>of</hi> Angels, <hi>but he took on him the</hi> Seed <hi>of</hi> Abraham. I know well enough, that it is objected, That the Original imports, that he took not <hi>hold</hi> of the Angels, but he took <hi>hold</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and it is confeſſed, that the <hi>Greek</hi> will admit and approve ſuch an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; and (which is more) the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation is cloſe and proper ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Language;</hi> but then it is not full, ſo far as concerns the <hi>Context:</hi> For when we are told <hi>before,</hi> that <hi>he took part of the Fleſh and Blood whereof his Children were made;</hi> and when we are told immediately <hi>after</hi> the Words, that <hi>in all things it behoved him to be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49679:60"/>made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful High-Prieſt;</hi> we may eaſily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he took on him the Nature of ſuch his Children, and of ſuch his Brethren. But that by the by, to aſſert and make good the Propriety and Validity of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, againſt the Adverſaries of the Incarnation. But more directly to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Since the Son of God, the Saviour of Mankind, was pleaſed to interpoſe for the Redemption of faln <hi>Man,</hi> but did not do ſo for the Redemption of faln <hi>Angels;</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>loſt</hi> and forlorn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>one,</hi> when compared to the <hi>reſtored</hi> Condition of the <hi>other,</hi> muſt needs afford a weighty Argument of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to <hi>Man,</hi> when he finds his <hi>own</hi> Safety and Welfare preferred by the Saviour, to that of <hi>Angels,</hi> and has not only a <hi>Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> but alſo the comfortable <hi>Hopes</hi> and (if it be not his own Fault) an <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of that Salvation, of which they muſt for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Now, Natural Reaſon might perhaps incline us to think, that the Reſcue of the faln Angels by a Saviour might therefore have been a more honourable <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Angels are a more noble <hi>Creature;</hi> and the <hi>Dignity</hi> of ſuch a Creature might ſeem to countenance the <hi>preference</hi> of ſuch a Purchaſe. But in theſe Things our Reaſon is ſhort-ſighted, and we may eaſily judge <hi>amiſs,</hi> becauſe we judge in the <hi>Dark.</hi> Thus much,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49679:60"/>however, to our preſent purpoſe, we are ſure of, and that is, that it is a <hi>greater</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to ſtoop to the Relief of an <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> Creature; and that where there is <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Condeſcenſion,</hi> there that Creature is obliged to the <hi>greater Gratitude.</hi> And <hi>this</hi> is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly our <hi>Caſe;</hi> and therefore ſuch <hi>Gratitude</hi> is undoubtedly our <hi>Duty.</hi> Let us therefore with Heart and Voice rejoice in this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Salvation of our God; the Salvation which old <hi>Simeon ſaw,</hi> and <hi>embraced</hi> before his Death; the Salvation, which St. <hi>John,</hi> the Beloved Diſciple, tells us, <hi>was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which we have</hi> heard, <hi>which we have</hi> ſeen <hi>with our Eyes, which we have</hi> looked <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our Hands have</hi> handled <hi>of the Word of Life:</hi> That is, in a few Words; The Word of Life, the Son of God, the Saviour of the World, by his Incarnation made manifeſt to our Senſes, and by the ſame Incarnation qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to be our Sacrifice, our High-Prieſt, our Redeemer. <hi>To him therefore be Glory and Praiſe in all Churches of the Saints. Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that we may learn to praiſe him aright, both for the Greatneſs and Condeſcenſion of his Mercy too; let us take theſe few, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules, to guide us in our Practice of ſuch Praiſes. For a verbal Thankſgiving is too poor an Offering for ſo ſuperlative a Bleſſing; and to praiſe God, who ſearches the Heart, with our Lips, when we do not do it with our Hearts, is in deed and truth to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49679:61"/>mock him. That we may not therefore <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> our <hi>Sins,</hi> when we pretend to <hi>perform</hi> our <hi>Duty,</hi> we may do well to guide our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the Caſe by theſe following Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Did our God condeſcend to take upon him our <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that he might by his <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> by his <hi>Example,</hi> by his <hi>Life,</hi> and by his <hi>Death, purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works,</hi> and ſo from a ſinful and degenerous Condition, exalt us to a State of Holineſs, and by conſequence of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Then we ought to meet our God in ſuch his gracious Deſign; and by lifting our Hearts towards Heaven, and ſo by ſetting them upon Heavenly Things, to endeavour to be <hi>holy, as he is holy.</hi> It is a noble Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and complies with the Counſel and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his Incarnation: For it will engage our Souls in higher Flights of Duty, and render us fit Inhabitants of that Place, where Holineſs is both the greateſt Happineſs, and the greateſt Ornament. For, tho' ſome of God's Attributes are ſo peculiar to himſelf, that they are utterly incommunicable to any of his Creatures; ſuch are his <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> his <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> and the like; yet there are others, which he has not only <hi>propoſed</hi> to our Imitation, but which alſo he has <hi>commanded</hi> us to imitate; and ſuch are his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>Mercy,</hi> his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in one Word, his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And therefore he does require <hi>us</hi> to be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49679:61"/>holy, becauſe <hi>he</hi> is holy. And it would be no hard matter to make it out, that his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is his <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>leading</hi> Attribute, ſuch as guides and conducts all the reſt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho' he be Omnipotent, yet for all that, he cannot do any thing that is unjuſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is holy. Does God then <hi>allow,</hi> nay require us to <hi>imitate</hi> him in his prime and leading Attribute, and by <hi>ſtooping</hi> to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, provoke us to <hi>exalt</hi> that Nature ſo far, as to make our ſelves like to him in thoſe Things, for which his Praiſe is chiefly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated? Then let us for once gratifie our Ambition the right way; and tho' we are but <hi>Men,</hi> yet let us in this attempt to make our ſelves like to <hi>God,</hi> as he in his Incarnation was pleaſed to make <hi>himſelf</hi> like to <hi>us.</hi> The Attempt is great and generous, and worthy the Endeavours of our beſt Endowments, and moſt noble Faculties: For, if we chearfully caſt off our Sins, and, by a conſtant and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Practice of Holineſs, do make it our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to be like our Saviour, holy and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, as he our High-Prieſt was, we ſhall in ſome ſenſe lift our ſelves above the Earth, even while we inhabit in it; and tho' we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>get up</hi> to Heaven, yet we ſhall, by that means, bring Heaven <hi>down</hi> into our Souls, and ſo ſhall in ſome meaſure anticipate our conſummate Happineſs. And ſince the grand Deſign of our Saviour's Humiliation in his Incarnation, was to engage us to this holy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49679:62"/>Ambition; let us have a care, that we do not defeat ſuch his Deſign, and our own greateſt Hopes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Did our Saviour, by taking our Fleſh and Blood, and ſo uniting it to himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate our Nature to the great and noble Purpoſes of Holineſs and Mercy? And did he alſo, by ſo doing, ſo intimately unite us to himſelf, that we are Fleſh of his Fleſh, Bone of his Bone, and Members of his Body? Then this ſhould teach us, to have a more ſacred and eſpecial Care, by no means to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute That, which he has ſo conſecrated. And therefore what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in the Caſe of Fornication, <hi>[Shall I take the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot? God forbid,]</hi> that we may ſay in all other like Caſes; Shall we take the Members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and make them the Members of a Drunkard, of an unclean, of an intemperate Perſon, or indeed of any other Sinner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? God forbid. For, we ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to abuſe our Bodies, which by his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are ſo nearly allied to his Body, that they are the ſame Fleſh and Blood with it: I ſay, we ſhould be aſhamed to abuſe them by ſuch Practices, which we muſt needs know, his Soul abhors: And this our Shame ſhould therefore be attended with the greater Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe whereas he took upon him our Fleſh, that in that Fleſh he might <hi>work</hi> out our <hi>Salvation;</hi> we, when we employ it in any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49679:62"/>Sin, do indeed employ it to its own utter <hi>Ruine</hi> and <hi>Damnation.</hi> Let us therefore have a care, that we be ſober, chaſt, temperate; becauſe otherwiſe we bring a Scandal upon our greateſt Friend and Benefactor: For, by abuſing our <hi>own</hi> Bodies, when we our ſelves are Members of <hi>his</hi> Body, we do by the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſuch our Doings abuſe <hi>his</hi> Body alſo.</p>
                     <p>And here I take my ſelf to be obliged to leave a Mark upon one Practice too too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral among Chriſtians; and that is, That when they do profeſſedly pretend to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the Infinite Mercy of their Saviour's Incarnation, they are ſo far from doing it in a way agreeable to his Honour, that, inſtead of that, they do too commonly do it by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, Surfeitings, and Drunkenneſs: And ſo when they pretend to offer to God, for their Saviour's Incarnation, the <hi>Praiſes</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> by their Manner of doing it, do render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more <hi>vile</hi> than <hi>Beaſts.</hi> Which Practice, as it is in it ſelf profligately <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>wicked;</hi> ſo it has brought ſuch a <hi>Scandal</hi> upon the Duty by ſuch its Wickedneſs, that not a few (and thoſe too devout and zealous <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> tho' their Zeal and Devotion does indeed want Wiſdom) have leaped over into the other Extreme, and have utterly diſallowed any Commemoration of the Infinite Bleſſing at all. So eaſily do fooliſh Men run into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes on both Sides, and leave the Golden Mean to be practiſed only by a few, that is, by the truly Wiſe.</p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49679:63"/>
                     <p n="3">3. Did our Saviour humble himſelf to our Nature and Condition, in order to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of our Salvation? Then this ſhould teach us to be like him in this very reſpect, and not to diſdain to ſtoop to our Inferiours, when by ſuch our Condeſcenſion we may any ways advantage their Welfare and real Intereſt. And for our doing ſo, we have in him the moſt noble Example, that ever yet the World was made acquainted with: For, in this Caſe we imitate the Condeſcenſion of our Lord and Maſter: Nay, when our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſtoops loweſt, it only ſtoops to our <hi>Fellow-Creatures,</hi> thoſe who are made of the ſame Lump of Clay with our ſelves, and thoſe who (as Things may fall out) may be as helpful and uſeful to us again. So that when we <hi>condeſcend</hi> to relieve <hi>them,</hi> we do, by ſo doing, <hi>teach</hi> them to relieve <hi>us,</hi> if ever the ſame, or the like Miſeries with theirs, ſhould become our <hi>own.</hi> And we are as ſure, that Things may ſo fall out, as we are ſure, that we are Men. Now becauſe our God did condeſcend to our Nature for the Relief of our Miſery, when the <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> and the <hi>Kindneſs</hi> was only <hi>His,</hi> and when the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> was only <hi>Ours;</hi> ſhall not we the rather practiſe ſuch a charitable Condeſcenſion, when by ſuch our Practice we do commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at leaſt our <hi>Own poſſible</hi> Condition? Shall the Son of God, by taking upon himſelf our Nature, make our Condition <hi>His,</hi> in order
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49679:63"/>to his <hi>more</hi> ſenſible Compaſſion of ſuch our Condition, and ſhall not we condeſcend for the Relief of thoſe of our <hi>own</hi> Kind; which, after one Remove, is for the Relief of our <hi>ſelves?</hi> For, if we be too proud in the Caſe to <hi>ſtoop</hi> to our <hi>Inferiours;</hi> yet methinks we ſhould not be too proud to <hi>imitate</hi> our <hi>God:</hi> And if the <hi>Infirmities</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> will not engage us to Condeſcenſion in order to <hi>Compaſſion;</hi> yet one would in reaſon be apt to think, that the <hi>Example</hi> of the other might do ſuch a thing. We ought therefore, in order to our Exaltation, to learn from him, that to do any good to our calamitous Brother, is not to debaſe our ſelves: For our Charity is not the leſs, but rather the more noble, for being extended to a thatched Cottage; and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Viſit to the meaneſt Man, where it is likely to prove beneficial to him, will always wear this Character. That it is a glorious Imitation of the Lord of Glory, who did not diſdain a perſonal Viſit to the meaneſt of his Creatures, whom he had endowed with Capacities of receiving that his ineſtimable Bleſſing, without which they muſt have been for ever miſerable.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Did our Saviour not only come to us clothed in our <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but did he alſo put on the Form of a <hi>Servant,</hi> in order to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of our Redemption? Then this his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhould inſtruct us to do our very beſt Works with <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> We are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49679:64"/>very apt to think our <hi>ordinary</hi> Performances (if in <hi>any</hi> degree Pious) to be <hi>extraordinary</hi> good; and not a few of us put ſuch a Value upon our good Deeds, that we ſpoil that little Goodneſs that is in them, by our over-valuing them; and our ſpiritual Pride, like the Fly in the Box of Ointment, robs them of their good Smell and Savour: But it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that in ſo doing we do not imitate our Lord and Maſter, who was meek and lowly, and by his Self-denial aſcribed ſuch his Good Works, which could not be hid, entirely to God's Glory. Why! what Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have, do confeſſedly come from God, the Author and Giver of every good thing; and therefore to aſcribe the Goodneſs of any thing we have, or of any thing we do, to our ſelves, is Uſurpation and Robbery. For, we may as well aſcribe to our ſelves our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> as we may our <hi>Spiritual</hi> Life: Both the one and the other derive from an higher Spring, and from a nobler Fountain. And he who has taught us by his <hi>Word</hi> to account our ſelves, when we have done all we can, but <hi>unprofitable</hi> Servants, has taught us by his <hi>Example</hi> to do <hi>more.</hi> For, <hi>He</hi> did exactly fulfil the Law, and <hi>his</hi> Obedience was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and yet, for all that, <hi>his</hi> Humility was great. And then, in Reaſon, becauſe <hi>our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances</hi> are <hi>leſs,</hi> our <hi>Humility</hi> ought to be <hi>greater.</hi> For, as <hi>Modeſty</hi> ſhould make us humble, when we do <hi>well;</hi> ſo our <hi>Defect</hi> in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49679:64"/>ſo doing, ſhould make us <hi>more</hi> ſo. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour's Example, which ſhewed forth the greateſt Humility in the Archieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt and nobleſt Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhould oblige us, poor, impotent, defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Creatures, to a greater (were that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) Humility.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Did our Saviour come down in our Fleſh to ſave Sinners, both from the <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> and <hi>Filth</hi> of Sin, and from the <hi>Wages</hi> of Sin too? Then this ſhould engage our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reſcue Sinners from the Errour of their Ways, and to do as he did, that is, to bring them to God by the Ways of Holineſs. This is a noble Leſſon, and has our Saviour's <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good-will,</hi> as well as his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> for its Pattern. For, a Man may be good and holy himſelf; and yet Self-intereſt (I mean an allowable Self-intereſt) may be at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it: He may fear God's Vengeance, ſhould he be wicked; and ſo his Goodneſs may have an Eye to his Security. But he, who endeavours to reclaim <hi>another</hi> Sinner from the Errour of his Ways, mixes <hi>Charity</hi> with his <hi>Piety,</hi> by making <hi>anothers</hi> Welfare his Aim, and by making more People happy beſides himſelf. Indeed, the Grand Buſineſs of our Saviour's coming into the World, was to redeem us from the Slavery and Dominion of Sin, (for, if we be not redeemed from our <hi>Sins,</hi> it is utterly impoſſible that we ſhould be redeemed from the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49679:65"/>them:) And therefore he, who endeavours the <hi>Converſion</hi> of Sinners, imitates his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in That, that was his <hi>chiefeſt</hi> and <hi>nobleſt</hi> Deſign. He endeavours to bring Rebel-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under the Dominion of their firſt and rightful Lord: He endeavours to defeat the Deſigns of the Devil for their utter Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: He endeavours, as far as his little Sphere reaches, to reſtore the Creation to that Order and Harmony that God gave it, when he firſt made it. And in all this, he does that which is his greateſt Glory; for he copies out the gracious and merciful Work of the Lord of Glory.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN order to our Vindication of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God for the Salvation of ſinful Man, ſo far forth as he has been pleaſed to make manifeſt ſuch his Counſel by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of his Word; we have made it out, that we had brought our ſelves into ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn a Condition by our Sins, that, ſo far as Reaſon guided by Revelation can diſcover, there was no poſſible Way left for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but only by the Incarnation of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49679:65"/>Son of God. And in purſuit of ſuch our Deſign, we have in our laſt Chapter made it good, That the Son of God was very God and very Man; God and Man united in one Perſon, or God Incarnate. That this is a Truth profeſſedly and expreſly declared in the Scriptures, and that too in ſuch Words, that it is impoſſible to expreſs any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever more plainly or more fully. That what the Spirit ſo declares in the Scriptures, is in no wiſe diſagreeable to our <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> and that upon both Accounts in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, it is to be admitted into our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Belief.</hi> For, undoubtedly, whatever God ſpeaks, that is not diſagreeable to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ought by us ſo to be admitted.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe, in order to a Goſpel-Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Goſpel-Forgiveneſs is required; and becauſe, in order to a Goſpel-Forgiveneſs, an Expiation is required; and becauſe we have already made it good, That no mere Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can by any Means whatſoever make out ſuch an Expiation: Therefore we ſhall, in what is now to follow, make it our Buſineſs to ſhew, That the Incarnation of the Son of God is (as by the Scriptures, ſo alſo) by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon, the moſt congruous Means, and the beſt accommodated, for the making good of ſuch an Expiation. For, we may be very ſure, that the All-wiſe God always makes uſe of the moſt proper Means to bring about the Deſigns of his Counſels: And we may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49679:66"/>be ſure alſo, that where he himſelf tells us, that he makes uſe of any Means for the bringing any ſuch his Deſigns to paſs, that what in ſuch a Caſe he tells us, is Truth. If therefore he tells us, that he employed the Incarnation of his Son for the Expiation of Sin, or that his Son was Incarnate in order to ſuch Expiation; we may, for that Reaſon alone, (if yet there were no other) be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſatisfied, that ſuch his Son's Incarnation was a proper Means of bringing to paſs ſuch an Expiation. For, the Methods of <hi>God's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in any Caſe whatſoever, are therefore <hi>Wiſe,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>his:</hi> And if at any time we cannot diſcover the Wiſdom of ſuch Methods, it would be both modeſt and wiſe in us to impute the Want of ſuch Diſcovery, not to the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> but to the <hi>Short-ſightedneſs</hi> of our own feeble and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Capacities. Now all this I therefore ſpeak, not that I think that the Wiſdom and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of the Incarnation, in order to the Expiation of Sin, cannot be rationally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, (for, I hope, we ſhall by and by find it otherwiſe) but only to check the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of ſome, who make great Pretences to Reaſon, (even ſuch Pretences, that they do laboriouſly and induſtriouſly endeavour to bring down the moſt expreſs Revelations of God to the Standard of ſuch their Reaſon) but ſeem to take no care to bring their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to an Accommodation with ſuch Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:49679:66"/>
                     <p>But to return to our Deſign, which is to make it out, That the Incarnation of the Son of God is a Means wiſely, as well as mercifully ordained for making good the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of Sin: Let us firſt hear what the Spirit ſaith, who in the Fourth to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the Fourth and Fifth Verſes, tells us, That <hi>when the Fulneſs of Time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> (that is, his Son was Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and was under the Law, and therefore made ſo, as to be obliged to be obedient to it) <hi>to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> And when we are told in one place, That <hi>the Son of God was manifeſted for this very purpoſe, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil;</hi> and in another, That <hi>he was manifeſt to take away Sin:</hi> And when to anſwer <hi>to,</hi> and explain the Meaning <hi>of</hi> theſe Places, we are aſſured from other Places, that at leaſt one Way of his taking away Sins was <hi>by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelf,</hi> as in the Twenty ſixth Verſe of the Ninth to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and that <hi>he appeared for that very purpoſe,</hi> in the ſame Place: And when we add to all this, what we find in the Fifth Verſe of the following Chapter, that <hi>God had prepared him a Body;</hi> and in the Tenth Verſe, that <hi>we are ſanctified</hi> (that is, our Sins are put away) <hi>through the offering of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all, who</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>his own ſelf bare
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49679:67"/>our Sins in his own Body on a Tree:</hi> I ſay, when the Spirit of God does all along in the Scriptures expreſly and categorically tell us, That our Saviour ſuffered in his Body, ſhed his Blood, loſt his Humane Life for our Sins, for the Remiſſion of Sin, for the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners; when it does in ſeveral Places compare his Death to the Expiatory Sacrifices under the Law; when it calls him the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> (alluding to the Paſchal Lamb) <hi>that taketh away the Sins of the World;</hi> when it tells us, that <hi>he is the Propitiation for our Sins,</hi> and the like; It does by theſe, and ſuch like Expreſſions (as much as Words can do it) acquaint us at the ſame time, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his Body, and died to atone for and to expiate our Sins. And therefore all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth and forced Interpretations of theſe and ſuch like Texts (which yet are a multitude) that attempt to evacuate their plain Meaning, may as ſoon perſuade an honeſt and ſincere Man, that the Scriptures both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are a Book full of Colluſion and Prevarication, as they may, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Saviour did not die to expiate the Sins of Mankind. And were I not aſſured of God's Providence, I ſhould be apt to fear, that the Devil might in time ſo bring Things about, that if he could upon Pretences of Reaſon wipe away that Part of the <hi>Bible</hi> that concerns our Saviour's <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and the <hi>Relation</hi> which that has to Man's <hi>Redemption,</hi>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:49679:67"/>that he might at laſt raiſe his Hopes of blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the <hi>whole Chriſtian Religion.</hi> For, to tell us, that our Saviour is only ſuch a Man, as other Men are, but only conceived in a different, and therefore more wonderful manner; to tell us, that he died patiently, tho' wrongfully, only that he might give us an Example of an exact Patience, and of an entire Submiſſion to God's Providence; to tell us, that he was ſlain a Sacrifice only to <hi>confirm</hi> the Covenant of Grace, but that there was no ſuch Deſign in his Death, as to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for, or to <hi>expiate</hi> our Sins; as it is a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Contradiction to,</hi> and not an <hi>Expoſition of</hi> the Scriptures; ſo, for that very Reaſon, it will appear to have a direct Tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the overthrowing the Grand Deſign of the whole Book of God: All which, to them who ſhall ſcan the Scriptures exactly, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>to,</hi> and does center <hi>in</hi> the Saviour, and that Redemption which he purchaſed for Mankind by his Death and Merits.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore thus in ſhort taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what the Scripture tells us, concerning the Expiation of Sin by the Suſſerings of our Saviour; and having already made it out,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no Creature can by any means expiate the Sin of Mankind; and,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That our Saviour is God Incarnate, or God and Man united in One Perſon, we do, in purſuit of our main Deſign, lay it down in the</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49679:68"/>
                     <p n="3">3. Third place, That the Way and Method of Man's Salvation (as it is expreſly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently laid down in the Scriptures, which is by the Sufferings and Death of the Son of God manifeſted in the Fleſh) is agreeable to right Reaſon, and exactly congruous to the Meaſures of Truth, and to the Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And, in order to our making this plain and clear, we take notice,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That that Law, about the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of which, and the <hi>Releaſe</hi> from the <hi>Penalty</hi> of ſuch Tranſgreſſion, the Goſpel-Forgiveneſs is only concerned, was given to <hi>Man.</hi> For, the Scriptures give us no Account of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of the Breach of any <hi>other</hi> Law, but only of <hi>that</hi> Law, which God had preſcribed to <hi>Mankind.</hi> And therefore, tho' in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures we have ſeveral broad Hints of the Fall of the Angels; and tho' our Reaſon tells us, that that which put them under the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God, muſt needs be <hi>Sin</hi> in the general; yet we are therefore ignorant <hi>what</hi> their Sin was, becauſe we are ignorant what that <hi>Law</hi> was, againſt which they ſinned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We take notice, That as that <hi>Law,</hi> about which alone the Goſpel-Forgiveneſs is concerned, was the Law given by God to <hi>Man;</hi> ſo the Goſpel takes no other or farther notice of the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of that Law, than as that Law is broke by <hi>Man.</hi> From whence we infer in the</p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:49679:68"/>
                     <p n="3">3. Third place, That that Puniſhment, which the Law threatens againſt thoſe who tranſgreſs it, can only in Juſtice belong to <hi>thoſe,</hi> to whom the Law was <hi>given</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</hi> For, they can never <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> a Law, who have no Law <hi>aſſigned</hi> them; and they can never be juſtly <hi>puniſhed,</hi> for the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, who can never <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> the Law. The Law therefore, about which alone a Goſpel-Forgiveneſs is concerned, being the Law given to Man, and tranſgreſſed by Man; Man alone can juſtly ſuffer the Penalty of ſuch Tranſgreſſion. From whence we infer in the</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourth place, That if any Penalty can ever juſtly expiate that Guilt, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the Breach of the Law; that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, that muſt make ſuch Expiation, muſt be a Penalty laid upon <hi>Man.</hi> And therefore our Common Senſe of Juſtice will not allow us to think, that either <hi>Angels,</hi> which are ranked <hi>above</hi> Mankind; nor <hi>Beaſts,</hi> which are ranked <hi>below</hi> them, can by any Sufferings whatſoever expiate or atone for the Breach of ſuch Law, which being given by God to <hi>Man,</hi> does ſo far forth <hi>concern</hi> Man <hi>alone.</hi> And tho' we have before made it out, that neither Angels on the one Hand, nor brute Beaſts on the other, can expiate the Sin of Mankind, as both the one and the other are <hi>Creatures;</hi> yet what we now ſay, is, that they cannot do it as they are <hi>different</hi> Creatures.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49679:69"/>For, it ſeems neceſſary, and that too in the Nature of the Thing it ſelf, that Creatures ſo different ſhould be under different Laws; and that therefore neither their Obedience to, nor their Tranſgreſſion of thoſe ſeveral Laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they are, ſhould have any ſuch Concern or Relation to one another, as that <hi>one</hi> ſort of Creature ſhould in any Caſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Penalty of the Tranſgreſſions of the <hi>other</hi> ſort of Creature. And therefore, for the ſame Reaſon that we ſhould look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as abſurd and unjuſt, that a <hi>Man</hi> ſhould ſuffer for the Sin of an <hi>Angel;</hi> I ſay, for the ſame Reaſon, we ſhould think it no leſs abſurd and unjuſt, that an <hi>Angel</hi> ſhould ſuffer for the Sin of a <hi>Man.</hi> The Thing might be made out in more Words: But it needs not.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe few Remarks being left by the way, to give Perſpicuity and Strength to thoſe Things which are to follow; the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Juſtice, Reaſonableneſs,</hi> and <hi>Congruity</hi> of the Redemption of Mankind by the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Death of our Saviour (as that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is expreſly laid down in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) will appear from theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, Our Saviour, who by his Death and Sufferings undertook the Purchaſe of Man's Redemption, was as really and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a Man <hi>himſelf,</hi> as were <hi>thoſe, whom</hi> he undertook to redeem. This is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is all along in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49679:69"/>called <hi>Man, the Son of Man,</hi> and the like, (as we have made it out already.) And this ſo far accommodates the Scripture-Account of the Purchaſe of Man's Salvation, to the Law, that,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As the Law threatned the Puniſhment to <hi>Man alone,</hi> and to no <hi>other</hi> Creature; ſo in the Purchaſe of the Redemption, Man <hi>alone</hi> ſuffered ſuch Puniſhment, and no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>beſides.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And ſecondly, As it accommodates the Scripture-Account of the Purchaſe of Man's Redemption, to the <hi>Law;</hi> becauſe our Saviour, who ſuffered in order to ſuch Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, was a <hi>Man:</hi> So it accommodates the Scripture-Account of the Purchaſe of Man's Redemption, to the Rules of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> becauſe our Saviour, who ſuffered in order to ſuch Purchaſe, was an <hi>Innocent</hi> Man. It may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at firſt ſight look ſtrange, when I ſay, that the Purchaſe of Redemption by the Death of an Innocent Man, is accommodated to the Rules of Juſtice: But the Wonder will then vaniſh, when I ſhall come to make it out, that tho' an Innocent Man cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>own</hi> Conſent be <hi>juſtly</hi> puniſhed; yet that <hi>with</hi> ſuch his Conſent, he <hi>may</hi> be ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. But becauſe That belongs to another Place, therefore in this I paſs it by. For, that that I deſign at preſent, is only to ſhew, that it is not agreeable to the Laws of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that a <hi>Criminal</hi> againſt the Law ſhould
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49679:70"/>expiate <hi>another</hi> Man's Sin, by ſuffering the Penalty of the Law: Becauſe the Penalty, which he ſuffers, being the juſt Demerit and Wages of his <hi>own</hi> Sin, he cannot, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the Puniſhment of his <hi>own</hi> Sin, add any ſuch Deſert to ſuch his Puniſhment, as to make it meritorious of Impunity to any <hi>other</hi> Sinner. As therefore under the laſt Head we learnt, that he who by his Puniſhment expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the Sin of another <hi>Man,</hi> muſt in Reaſon and Congruity be a <hi>Man</hi> himſelf; ſo under this Head we may learn, that he muſt be an <hi>Innocent</hi> Man likewiſe. And ſo the Sufferings and Death of our Saviour for the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind, will afford us a further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity to the Rules of Reaſon and Juſtice, in that that Saviour is exhibited to us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, not only to be a <hi>Man,</hi> but alſo to be an <hi>Innocent</hi> Man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Redemption of Mankind, by the Sufferings and Death of our Saviour, as that Saviour was a <hi>Man,</hi> will yet farther and more notoriouſly appear, if we conſider the firſt <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Formation</hi> of Mankind according to that Account which the Scriptures give us of it: For, there we are told in general, that <hi>God did of one Blood make all Nations of Men, for to dwell on the Face of the whole Earth,</hi> in the Seventeenth Chapter of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> And then, if we look back to the original Creation of Mankind, and there
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49679:70"/>enquire more particularly how this was done; we ſhall from thence be informed, that God firſt made <hi>Adam</hi> out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and that after that he made <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adam,</hi> (both of them extraordinary and miraculous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions) and that then, through all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations, he formed <hi>all</hi> the reſt of Mankind out of <hi>both,</hi> or ſuch ſucceeding Pairs which <hi>proceeded</hi> from both, (to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Man as miraculous, tho' a more ordinary Production than that of the firſt Man and Woman.) So that all Mankind are by the Scripture-Account of the Thing a continued Propagation of the Blood of <hi>Adam,</hi> branched out through the ſeveral Diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all ſucceeding Men and Women, from his Days to this preſent Time. Now our Saviour, as he was Man, took part of this Fleſh and Blood, (ſo the Scripture) and by doing ſo, became a Part of that Common Blood, out of which all the particular Men in the World are, and always have been made, as well as he. he ſtands therefore in as near a Relation to all Mankind, as can poſſibly be made by the ſame Fleſh and Blood; and that Relation may well be granted to be very near, becauſe it is that very Relation, which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of a Thing (by continued deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation the ſame) have to one another. And ſo far the Relation of our Saviour to the reſt of Mankind is in all Circumſtances exactly the ſame with that Relation, which every
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49679:71"/>
                        <hi>other</hi> Man has to every <hi>other.</hi> But yet there is ſomething peculiar to our <hi>Saviour</hi> in his becoming Man, which does not belong to any <hi>other</hi> Man whomſoever: And that is, that as the firſt <hi>Woman</hi> was formed only out of the <hi>Man,</hi> ſo our <hi>Saviour</hi> was formed only out of the <hi>Woman.</hi> And accordingly, the firſt Promiſe of Redemption, that God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> after he had ſinned, was Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally worded, when he told him, that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpent's Head.</hi> And therefore, as <hi>Adam</hi> is in the Scriptures called the <hi>firſt</hi> Man, becauſe he was formed out of the <hi>Earth;</hi> ſo our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is called the <hi>ſecond</hi> Man in the ſame Scriptures, becauſe he was formed out of the <hi>Woman;</hi> that is, <hi>he</hi> was the firſt Man after <hi>his</hi> Kind, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in <hi>his.</hi> To our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Purpoſe and Deſign then: As we cannot but take notice, that God's Counſel and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Purpoſe for the Redemption of Mankind was very early, (for that Counſel muſt needs be ſo, that was in a manner Cotemporary to Man's firſt Sin, as the immediate Diſcovery of that Counſel to Man upon the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Sin does make it appear) ſo ſome Glimpſes of that Counſel do (to me) ſeem to ſhew forth themſelves in the Scripture-Account of Man's Creation. For, when God tells us in his Word, that he has ſo ordered the Creation, Propagation, and Diſſeminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind, that tho' their Numbers are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49679:71"/>to us Innumerable, yet we do for all that know, that they all came from one ſingle Fountain, that is, from one ſingle Man; and ſo, that they are all but ſo many Rivulets from that Fountain: And when, moreover, we are aſſured, that our Saviour is One of thoſe Rivulets; (For, tho' our Saviour was only to be made of the Woman, yet becauſe the Woman was made out of the Man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour did by the Woman derive from the ſame one ſingle Perſon with the reſt of Mankind) I ſay, when we conſider all this, methinks it is no hard matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that God himſelf does in his Word lay the Ground-work of Man's Redemption by a Saviour (if I may be allowed ſo to word my ſelf) in that near and intimate Relation, which our Saviour, by becoming Man, has to all Mankind beſides; and that the Intimacy of ſuch Relation conſiſts in this, that the Saviour and all Mankind do derive from one ſingle and common Fountain. And hence we are told in one Place, that <hi>as by Man came Death,</hi> (there is the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Wages of ſuch Sin) <hi>by Man came alſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead,</hi> (there is the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of our Saviour, and his Purchaſe.) And more expreſly ſtill to our preſent Purpoſe, ſpeaks the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Chapter, (the Fifteenth of the Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) <hi>For as in Adam all died, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49679:72"/>again, in the Fifth to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the Eighteenth Verſe, <hi>Therefore as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the Free-gift came upon all Men unto Juſtification of Life.</hi> In all which Texts, and ſeveral others that might be named, it is notorious, that the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Mankind is ſo aſcribed to the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of Mankind is aſcribed to the <hi>firſt</hi> Man <hi>Adam.</hi> And I do not at all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but that thoſe Hints, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do frequently offer to us, of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's taking the Humane Nature in order to our Redemption, of his taking Part of the ſame Fleſh and Blood with us, of his being our Brother, and the like; I ſay, I do not at all queſtion, but that, when ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they may mightily aſſiſt and facilitate both our Conceptions and Belief of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Juſtice, Reaſonableneſs, and Congruity of our Saviour's Incarnation, Death, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; in one Word, of that Redemption, which he, by being made one with Mankind, by taking their Nature upon himſelf, has purchaſed form them: And may mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Removing of thoſe Difficulties which the Enemies of the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> have thrown as ſo many Stumbling-blocks in the Way of plain and honeſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Wiſdom, Juſtice, Reaſonableneſs, and Congruity of our Saviour's Incarnation,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49679:72"/>in order to his Purchaſe of Man's Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does yet farther appear, in that by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Man, he put himſelf into a Capacity of <hi>ſuffering</hi> Death, that is, of ſuffering that <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> which the Law had <hi>denounced</hi> againſt thoſe that ſhould <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> it. For, it is a groſs Miſtake, and does indeed bring a Scandal upon God's Veracity, to affirm, That he <hi>threatens</hi> greater Vengeance in any Law, <hi>before</hi> the Tranſgreſſion of it, than he will <hi>execute after</hi> the Tranſgreſſion, that ſo he may the <hi>more</hi> effectually <hi>prevent</hi> ſuch Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For, God never yet threatned any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory and unconditional Puniſhment in any Law, which he has not, or, when the Time comes, he will not as certainly execute. <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> ſays God. The Threatning, we ſee, is peremptory; and the Execution, we find, is ſo too; and therefore all Sinners die. And I cannot in the leaſt doubt, but that, for the ſame Reaſon, an eternal Puniſhment will be the certain Vengeance upon a final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But that is not ſo direct to my preſent purpoſe, and therefore here I paſs it by. But, to confirm what I am now upon, I ſay, that God does not pardon the Death threatned in his Law againſt Sin, no not in Conſideration of the Death of our Saviour; and therefore, notwithſtanding <hi>his</hi> Death, and that too in <hi>our</hi> ſtead, we ſee, that all Men, and even thoſe who hope for Salvation by ſuch his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49679:73"/>Death, do yet die. What therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this Caſe has puchaſed for us, is not a <hi>Freedom,</hi> but a <hi>Releaſe</hi> from Death: And therefore <hi>that</hi> Redemption from Death, which is the Purchaſe of his Blood, is to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed (after we have been dead) by a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> A Reſurrection then is to make good the Purchaſe of his Death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death purchaſed for us not a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> but a <hi>Releaſe</hi> from our Death by ſuch Reſurrection. Now, as his <hi>Death</hi> was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſuch a <hi>Purchaſe;</hi> ſo his <hi>Incarnation</hi> was neceſſary in order to ſuch his <hi>Death:</hi> And he was therefore made of the ſame Blood with all Mankind, that by ſhedding that Blood for Mankind, he might after his own Reſurrection reſtore the Lives of all Men, which had been forfeited by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. So that as his Death was the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>Expiation</hi> of Sin; and as a Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> of ſuch his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation: So his <hi>Incarnation</hi> was a neceſſary <hi>Forerunner</hi> of ſuch his <hi>Death;</hi> and therefore before he could poſſibly die for Man, and ſo purchaſe a Redemption of Man from Death, it was agreeable to the Laws of Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Reaſon, that he ſhould become Man himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But then, how his Death came to be of ſo valuable a Price, as to make ſo glorious a Purchaſe, we muſt leave to farther Enquiry. For, by that it will appear, that as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49679:73"/>that he ſhould die the Death of a Man; ſo it was neceſſary, that ſuch his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ſhould be united to the Divinity: And by both it will appear, that <hi>God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the Fleſh to deſtroy the Works of the Devil;</hi> and that therefore, when the Scriptures tell us ſo much, they tell us no more than what is agreeable to Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Reaſon.</p>

                     <p>HAving therefore ſeen, that our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was qualified by his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to make an Expiation for Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf; and that ſuch his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification is agreeable to the Laws of Juſtice, and to the Rules of Reaſon, and Wiſdom: Our next Enquiry muſt be, How ſuch his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice came to be of ſuch a <hi>Value,</hi> as to be juſtly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to make good ſuch an Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, becauſe the Death of an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man (if he be no more than a mere Man) is but the Death of a Creature; and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49679:74"/>becauſe no Creature can by its Puniſhment in another Creature's ſtead, expiate the Sin of that other Creature; (for if it could, then a Creature might by its own Puniſhment expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate its own Sin, both which we have already ſhewed to be impoſſible;) Therefore it was neceſſary, that as our Saviour, in order to his <hi>undertaking</hi> the Expiation of Sin, ſhould be a <hi>real Man,</hi> a <hi>Creature;</hi> ſo, that he ſhould be <hi>more</hi> than a Creature, in order to the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing</hi> of ſuch his <hi>Undertaking.</hi> For, tho' by becoming <hi>Man,</hi> he did accommodate his <hi>Condition</hi> to his <hi>Deſign</hi> of undertaking an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation (as we have juſt now ſeen) yet, for all that, his Humanity had <hi>ſunk under,</hi> but but had not <hi>taken away</hi> the Burden, had it not been ſupported by his <hi>Divinity.</hi> For, that that cruſhes both Angels and Men, (and that too, while they cope againſt it only with their own Strength) beyond the poſſibility of a Recovery, muſt, for the ſame Reaſon, have cruſhed him alſo, (when once he had put himſelf in Man's ſtead, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence into Man's Condition) had he not been endowed with a Power ſuperiour to both, to enable him to ſubdue and conquer it. And what Power, but that of God, can we think ſufficient to conquer Sin and Death; and that too, when they had got to ſuch an heighth, as to have infected and over-run the whole Race of Mankind? Can we think, that when the Contagion and Miſchief had
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49679:74"/>ſpread it ſelf ſo wide, that even the beſt of Men (and thoſe whoſe Graces are chiefly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by the Spirit of God himſelf) could not preſerve themſelves from the overflowing Inundation; I ſay, can we think, that in ſuch a Caſe any one ſingle Man (were he no more than a Man) could have ſaved <hi>himſelf</hi> from the univerſal Miſchief, by the Strength of his own Reſolution or Vertue? And if in Reaſon we muſt think, that he could not; then how can we in Reaſon think, that his Strength ſhould be ſufficient to reſcue and ſave <hi>all the Reſt?</hi> No! Such Salvation belongs only to the Arm of God; and He, who can ſave from Sin, Death, and Hell, and can over and above extend ſuch Salvation over all the Earth, and that too through all the ſucceſſive Generations of Mankind, that ever did, or ever ſhall live upon the Earth, muſt be God, and God alone. The <hi>Extenſive Merit</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Death and Sufferings of the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> derives it ſelf from the Infinite <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son of God.</hi> For, had not this <hi>Jeſus</hi> been the Son of <hi>God,</hi> as well as the Son of <hi>Man,</hi> he had never been the <hi>Saviour</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> And if <hi>there be not Salvation in any other,</hi> (as in effect the whole Book of God does tell us) it may ſeem inconceivable, how this Seed of the Woman ſhould extend this Salvation, and ſo break the Serpent's Head, from the Days of <hi>Adam</hi> to the Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Things, unleſs all Things were in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49679:75"/>his Diſpoſal, that is, unleſs he were God. No! He who conſiders the Thing ſeriouſly and wiſely, may be ſatisfied not only by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but by his own <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo, that there is the ſame Mercy, and the ſame Power required to <hi>redeem ſinful</hi> Man, that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to <hi>make</hi> Man; and that <hi>He</hi> only, who <hi>did</hi> the <hi>firſt, can</hi> do the <hi>laſt.</hi> And therefore, as we are taught by God, that all Things were made by his Word; ſo are we alſo, that this Word was made Fleſh, and that by being ſo made, he became to us, after we were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, the Word of Life. From all which, and a great deal more that might be offered, both from Reaſon, and from Revelation, (ſome of which Things we <hi>have already</hi> ſpoken to, and ſome of which we <hi>ſhall</hi> have <hi>occaſion</hi> to ſpeak to <hi>hereafter</hi>) we may be not only <hi>informed,</hi> but <hi>aſſured,</hi> That the great Merit of our Saviour's Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation made for Sin by his Death and Paſſion, did ariſe from hence, that his Divinity was perſonally united to that Body, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went ſuch Death; or, that nothing leſs than the Death of the Son of God could expiate that Death, which the Law had denounced againſt the Sin of Man. But becauſe theſe Thing will appear in a more full and clear Light, in the farther Proſecution of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; therefore we here leave them for a while, and proceed.</p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:49679:75"/>
                     <p>For, it having appeared, as to Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and that too by moſt expreſs Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture, that our Saviour was made an Expiatory Sacrifice for Sin; and it having alſo appeared, that he did by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation accommodate his Condition to the making good of ſuch Expiation, and that too in a Way very agreeable to our Natural Senſe and Reaſon: The next Thing to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, is, the Matter of <hi>Right,</hi> or whether or no he could make ſuch Expiation in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</hi> But before we proceed to ſpeak to That, it will be proper that we make ſome Inferences of weight and moment, from what has been already ſpoken. And,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By what has been ſaid, it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That tho' our Saviour made good the Purchaſe of our Redemption by his Death and Reſurrection; yet that ſuch his Purchaſe ſhall not be fully made over to us, till our own Reſurrection. That he made good the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, his Reſurrection is a Demonſtration: For, becauſe the Wages of Sin is Death, and becauſe he died for <hi>our</hi> Sins, and not for his <hi>own,</hi> and becauſe after ſuch his Death he roſe again, and becauſe ſuch his Reſurrection was a Diſcharge from the Penalty of thoſe Sins, for which he died; I ſay, from all theſe Things it is evident, that he accompliſhed his deſigned Purchaſe, that is, he made good his Expiation by his Death and Reſurrection. But then, on the other ſide, becauſe it is moſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49679:76"/>certain, that we are not redeemed from the <hi>Curſe</hi> or <hi>Penalty</hi> of the Law, till we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from <hi>Death;</hi> and becauſe we are not redeemed from <hi>Death,</hi> till we <hi>riſe</hi> from the Dead, that is, till our <hi>own Reſurrection;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is as evident, that till ſuch our Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection we are not put into the Poſſeſſion of ſuch his Purchaſe. And therefore (ſtrictly ſpeaking) no Man (be he who he will) is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>actually juſtified in this Life. For, becauſe every Man that lives ſhall certainly die, and becauſe Death is the Penalty threatned to Sin by the Law; it therefore grates too hard upon our common Senſe, to tell us, that any Man is then juſtified, when he is not only <hi>liable</hi> to the Vengeance of the Law, but when he is alſo ſure in a little time to <hi>undergo</hi> ſuch Vengeance. If therefore any Man be, according to a Goſpel-eſtimate of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a righteous or good Man, we may upon that Account ſay, (and we ſhall ſay true) that he is in a juſtifiable Condition; but we cannot truly ſay, that he is a juſtified Perſon. Juſtification then in the Execution belongs to a <hi>future</hi> Life, and not to <hi>this.</hi> And when we ſhall come to diſcourſe on the ſecond Thing contained in a Goſpel-Salvation, which is a Reſtitution to Holineſs, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of it, the Gift of Eternal Life, we ſhall then be more fully ſatisfied, that Juſtification cannot belong to any Man in this World, becauſe no Man in this World is reſtored to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49679:76"/>that Holineſs, which was loſt by the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law; and becauſe no Man ſhall be compleatly and actually juſtified, till he be ſo reſtored.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the <hi>Expiation</hi> of our Sin by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and by conſequence the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin by <hi>God,</hi> is not Abſolute, but Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal; and becauſe ſome of thoſe Conditions, upon which ſuch Pardon does depend, are to be performed by us, ſuch are our Repentance, Converſion, and the like; and becauſe, laſtly, our Condition in this World is ſuch, that there will of neceſſity be required <hi>Time</hi> for our Performance of ſuch Conditions: Therefore we do conclude, that as our Saviour has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us ſuch <hi>Conditions,</hi> in order to our Redemption; ſo has he alſo purchaſed for us a <hi>longer Term,</hi> in which we may <hi>perform</hi> ſuch Conditions. For, it is evident, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Law upon the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, is, <hi>[In the Day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.]</hi> And in ſtrict Juſtice and Reaſon, the Puniſhment is <hi>then</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, <hi>when</hi> it becomes <hi>due;</hi> and it then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>due,</hi> ſo <hi>ſoon</hi> as the Law is <hi>broken:</hi> For, were it not due <hi>then,</hi> it would never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come due <hi>at all.</hi> Now becauſe we find, and that too by Experience, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, but our <hi>own</hi> Sins too, we do not preſently die; but that God waits our Return, that he may be gracious to us; and becauſe we know, that ſuch his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49679:77"/>and Forbearance is therefore extended to us, that we may by our Repentance qualifie our ſelves to be made Partakers of that Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which is made by our Saviour, (for, <hi>there is not Salvation in any other</hi>) therefore we do at laſt conclude, that the Grant of a <hi>Space for Repentance</hi> is the Purchaſe of our Saviour. For, it would have been the ſame thing for our Saviour to have made no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for us at all, if ſuch his Purchaſe had been clogged with ſuch Conditions on our Part, which it was utterly impoſſible for us to perform: And it had been utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to make out our Repentance, and Amendment, if we had not been allowed a competent Time to make them out in.</p>
                     <p>And what we have ſaid concerning God's allowing of a competent <hi>Time</hi> in which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may perform the Conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant purchaſed by the Saviour, that we ſay alſo concerning the <hi>Means</hi> which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſuch their Performance: Such are his Word, the Succours and Aſſiſtance of his Spirit, his Sacraments, and whatever elſe does uſually come under the Title of <hi>Means of Grace.</hi> For, it is not conceivable, that our Saviour ſhould purchaſe for us the <hi>End,</hi> and yet leave us without the <hi>Means,</hi> which are neceſſary for the bringing about ſuch End. But yet becauſe the Means to enable us to perform the Conditions required of us in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Salvation, are not, nor indeed can
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49679:77"/>poſſibly be that very Salvation, for which they are deſigned or employed as means; and becauſe, while we live in this World we are required, and it is neceſſary in it ſelf, that we always have, and alſo employ ſuch Means to the purpoſe of our Juſtification; and laſtly, becauſe it is ſo far from being neceſſary, that it is neither proper, no nor wiſe, to employ any Means for any End already attained; therefore what we obſerved under our laſt Head, will ſtill remain true; and that is, That no Man is actually juſtified in this Life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From what has been ſaid, we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, That tho' Afflictions in this Life are undoubtedly the Executions of Juſtice; yet (which is owing to our Saviour's Purchaſe) there are always couched in ſuch Afflictions Deſigns of Mercy. For tho', as they look <hi>backward,</hi> they have an Eye to our <hi>Sins;</hi> yet, as they look <hi>forward,</hi> they have an Eye to our <hi>Amendment,</hi> or, at leaſt, to our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</hi> For, had we died for our Sins, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, we had been both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>puniſhed</hi> for our Sins <hi>paſt,</hi> and had by the ſame Means been <hi>prevented</hi> from ever ſinning for the time to <hi>come.</hi> (For, a Death without a Reſurrection, had proved a ſure and everlaſting Prevention.) But (as we have ſeen) our Life being continued in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour's Purchaſe (tho' Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are laid upon us during the Reprieve) and tho' ſuch Afflictions do confeſſedly come
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49679:78"/>from the Hand of Juſtice; yet they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid on without a Deſign and Mixture of Mercy: And therefore, as they are the <hi>Puniſhments</hi> of Sins <hi>paſt,</hi> ſo they are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Means of <hi>Grace</hi> for the time to <hi>come:</hi> And by the wiſe Counſel of our merciful and gracious God are employed (chiefly indeed for our future <hi>Reformation</hi>) but at leaſt for our future <hi>Reſtraint;</hi> and ſo are one, and a great Branch too, of what we call <hi>Reſtraining Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As therefore we took notice under our laſt Head, that the Reprieve of Man from the immediate Execution of the Sentence of the Law, was the Purchaſe of our Saviour, and that ſo Man's Life came to be continued, notwithſtanding his Tranſgreſſion; ſo under this Head we may obſerve, that tho' Sin, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch Continuance of Life, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by <hi>Death;</hi> yet the Juſt, Merciful, and All-wiſe God has not, even in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, left it without all <hi>Reſtraint;</hi> but has by Afflictions fitted ſuch a Curb for it, which (notwithſtanding the Saviour's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe) is an irrefragable Proof of his Juſtice: But tho' it be ſo, does in no wiſe <hi>encroach</hi> upon ſuch Purchaſe, but rather <hi>promotes</hi> the Deſign of it. For, a Life continued in order to the Performance of thoſe Conditions, by the Performance of which Man, in and through his Saviour, may obtain Salvation; A Life, I ſay, continued to ſuch a Purpoſe, is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49679:78"/>more likely to anſwer to ſuch Purpoſe, if its At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts after ſinful Commiſſions be reſtrained, than it could be, were ſuch Attempts left free and at large. For which Reaſon, ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, tho' it be cauſed by Afflictions, does rather <hi>fall in with,</hi> than <hi>controul</hi> the Deſign of our Saviour's Purchaſe. And tho' it be confeſſed, that ſuch <hi>Reſtraint</hi> is not ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for the Prevention of future Sins, as <hi>Death without any Reprieve</hi> had been, (for, in the <hi>laſt</hi> Caſe the Prevention had been <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> whereas in the <hi>firſt</hi> it is at the moſt but <hi>poſſible</hi>) yet it muſt be confeſſed alſo, that it is moſt wiſely ſuited to the Circumſtances of thoſe, about whom it is employed; and that for this Reaſon, Becauſe all Reſtraint being deſigned either to <hi>keep</hi> or to <hi>make</hi> them Good, it is neceſſary, in order to either, that it be left to their own <hi>Choice,</hi> whether they will improve it to <hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Deſigns, or no: For, there can be no Goodneſs at all, without ſuch Freedom. By all which we may at laſt underſtand, that tho' Afflictions, as well as Death, are the Wages of Sin; and tho' God does not let the reprieved Life of a Sinner paſs on without the Tokens of his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that is, in the preſent Caſe, without Afflictions; yet that it is owing to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that all ſuch Afflictions are employed as Means of Preventing Grace: Whereas otherwiſe, the Prevention of Sin by a Death without a Reprieve, that is, a Death without
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49679:79"/>a Saviour, and ſo without a Reſurrection, had been no Means of Grace at all, but only pure and mere Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Laſtly, From what has been ſaid, I take notice, that our Saviour, by his Expiation of Sin, did not purchaſe for us an <hi>Abſolute</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Death, ſo that by vertue of ſuch his Expiation we ſhould not die <hi>at all;</hi> but only a <hi>Releaſe</hi> from Death, ſo that after our Death we ſhould be <hi>raiſed to Life</hi> again. This I ſpake to before; and the thing is as certain, as it is certain, that all Men do die; and therefore I ſhall ſpeak no farther to it at preſent: Only one <hi>Quaere</hi> I would make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and that is this; Whether, becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> required <hi>Death</hi> as the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of Sin, and becauſe our <hi>Saviour,</hi> for the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> and for the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> was neceſſitated in his <hi>own</hi> Perſon to <hi>undergo</hi> Death; I ſay, Whether upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count God, by a Mixture of Mercy and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, might allow his Expiation to extend no farther than only to <hi>releaſe</hi> us from Death <hi>after</hi> we had ſuffered it, but not to <hi>prevent</hi> us from ſuffering it at <hi>all?</hi> But, as I ſaid before, I leave this as a <hi>Quaere,</hi> becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks nothing to it, and ſo the Reſolution of it lies in the dark. Only I thought it not amiſs to mention it, becauſe it may help to inſtruct us in the very great Malignity of Sin: As moſt undoubtedly that muſt be very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to God's Creatures, which is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49679:79"/>Enmity to him, who made them, and which is not wholly expiated by our Saviour himſelf.</p>
                     <p>However, the Wiſdom and Harmony of God's Truth, Juſtice, and Mercy do ſeem to me, from what has been ſaid, to ſhine forth very conſpicuouſly in his Counſel for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>For, tho' God <hi>executes</hi> that Death upon Man <hi>fatally,</hi> which, upon his Tranſgreſſion of the Law, he <hi>threatned peremptorily;</hi> and ſo, notwithſtanding the Death of our Saviour makes good the Truth of his Threat by the Execution of the Penalty: Yet for all that, he does not ſo execute ſuch Penalty, but that he firſt allows Man a Reprieve for a time, to make himſelf a fit Subject for his Saviour's Purchaſe; and, ſecondly, he grants him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from Death by a Reſurrection, to capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate him to be put into the actual Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch Purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>Again, tho' the Life of Man, continued in Conſideration of his Saviour's Merits, be ever and anon overcaſt with Afflictions; and tho' ſuch Afflictions are a Puniſhment for his Sins, and ſo a Proof of God's Juſtice: Yet ſtill thoſe very Afflictions are, in Conſideration of his Saviour, turned into Means of Grace, and ſo are a merciful Diſcipline to ſecure him from thoſe Miſchiefs, which otherwiſe might retard or defeat his Purſuit after the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Pardon and Inheritance.</p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49679:80"/>
                     <p>Theſe Remarks being left by the way, we proceed to the next thing propoſed, and that is, Whether our Saviour, as he did in Fact, ſo alſo might in <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> die for the Sins of Mankind? For, becauſe the Scriptures do lay down the Matter of Fact not only in <hi>expreſs</hi> Terms, but alſo in great <hi>variety</hi> of Expreſſions; and becauſe thoſe who deny the Doctrine of the Expiation, do in this Caſe, as they do in moſt others, oppoſe Reaſon to Revelation: Therefore, as by what has been ſaid already, we have made it out, that our Saviour <hi>did</hi> die for our Sins; ſo, in what is to follow, we ſhall endeavour to make it out alſo, that he <hi>might</hi> ſo die. For, if the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact be found to be the Declaration of God, we may be ſure, that it will have the Approbation of Juſtice: For, Juſtice and Truth can never claſh nor interfere. But however, before we begin, I cannot but take notice in the</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt place, That the Redemption of Mankind by our Saviour, is one of thoſe Things of God, which no Man knoweth, but the Spirit of God; and that, upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is not ſo proper a Subject for the Deliberations of Humane, that is, of ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Reaſon. And my Warrant for ſo judging I therefore take to be good, becauſe it was a Thing (as the Scriptures themſelves tell us) that was hid from Principalities and Powers, from Ages and Generations, till it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49679:80"/>was made known by God to his Church, that is, to thoſe who were <hi>chiefly,</hi> and, as to their <hi>own</hi> Perſons, <hi>only</hi> concerned in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are very ſure, that no Man, by the Sagacity of his own Reaſon, could ever have made any Diſcoveries of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I cannot but be ſatisfied, in the ſecond place, that any Man of an ordinary or of an extraordinary Underſtanding, who is willing in honeſty and ſincerity of Heart to receive the Scriptures as the Revelations of God; I ſay, I cannot but perſuade my ſelf, that ſuch a Man (and that too by the bare Conduct of his Common Senſe) would readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and accept it for a Truth in thoſe Scriptures revealed, that our Saviour ſuffered and died to expiate the Sins of Mankind: For, the Texts that aſſert it, are ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and, when compared, do ſo mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not only <hi>confirm</hi> each others <hi>Truth,</hi> but alſo <hi>explain</hi> each others <hi>Meaning;</hi> and the Management of the whole Thing is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly accounted for, and that through all the Stages and Periods of it, till our Saviour comes to offer his Sacrifice to God in the Heavens, the Place of his more peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence and Abode (as the High-Prieſt did typically in the like Caſe do in the Holy of Holies, the more peculiar Diſcovery of God's Reſidence among the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law:) I ſay, all theſe Things are ſo categorically aſſerted and explained, and ſo critically ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49679:81"/>for in the Revelations of God, that I cannot as yet perſuade my ſelf, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, and Common Sincerity will not oblige thoſe to receive and believe them, who are willing to receive thoſe Books, in which they are ſo laid down, for the Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Neither can I perſuade my ſelf, that Reaſon, if it be not ſpun too fine, (and what is ſo, may eaſily break) but, I ſay, I cannot perſuade my ſelf, that Reaſon, upon a ſober Examination of the Matter, (as it is laid down in the Scriptures) can in any wiſe call in queſtion the Juſtice of it. For, as it is there laid down, there are only three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more eſpecially concerned in it, and thoſe are, God, our Saviour, and Man. Let us therefore take the Sum of the Buſineſs in theſe Three Propoſitions, and then ſee, if our honeſt and natural Reaſon can diſcover any Injuſtice in it.</p>
                     <p>And, Firſt, God does forgive our Sins in Conſideration of our Saviour's Sufferings.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Our Saviour did ſuffer in our ſtead, in order to the obtaining of ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We do obtain ſuch Forgiveneſs in Conſideration of ſuch his Suffering.</p>
                     <p>Now if we ſet our plain and honeſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on work to examine, whether there be any Injuſtice in this whole Tranſaction; that will readily tell us, that if there be any ſuch Thing as Injuſtice in it, that Injuſtice muſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49679:81"/>be attributed to ſome of the <hi>Perſons</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. For, in this Caſe, it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſay, that the Tranſaction, either in the Whole, or in any Part of it, is unjuſt, unleſs we do particularly aſſign that <hi>Perſon</hi> engaged in it, to <hi>whom</hi> that Injuſtice does belong. For, all Injuſtice in Matters of Fact muſt be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to ſome <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>other:</hi> And no Injuſtice, in any Matter of Fact whatſoever, can be truly aſcribed to any Perſon whomſoever, if that Perſon be ſuppoſed to have nothing to do in that Matter of Fact. Now, in the Caſe, as it is put, there are (as we obſerved juſt now) no other Perſons concerned, but God, our Saviour, and our ſelves. If therefore the Thing prove to be, as by the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God it will be found to prove, that we Sinners are reconciled to God by the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Death, and Merit of our Saviour, and ſo are pardoned for our Sins; then it will follow, that if there be any Injuſtice in the Caſe, that Injuſtice muſt be either aſcribed to God, to our Saviour, or to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Now there cannot poſſibly be any Injuſtice in <hi>us,</hi> becauſe we are purely <hi>paſſive</hi> in the Caſe: For, ſo far forth as we are forgiven, (and that is as far as we are concerned) moſt certainly we are ſo. And we may be very ſure, that Reaſon will never tell any Man, that he is therefore a Criminal, becauſe he receives a great Bleſſing from God; and leaſt of all will it tell him, that it is a <hi>Sin</hi> in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49679:82"/>him to <hi>receive</hi> from God the <hi>Pardon</hi> of his Sins.</p>
                     <p>And I dare not ſo far queſtion the Modeſty of any Chriſtian, as to ſuppoſe, that they will fix any Injuſtice in the preſent Caſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon God, or upon our Saviour: And therefore becauſe no Injuſtice can be charged upon any of the Perſons concerned in the whole Affair; therefore, if we be but once ſatisfied, that God himſelf has told us in his Word, that the Affair was ſo managed, (as moſt certainly ſo he has told us) then the Concluſion at laſt muſt be, that there was no Injuſtice in it at all. I ſay, I am ſatisfied, that this would be the way of Reaſoning to a ſober and modeſt Chriſtian; and that this would be good and ſatisfactory, if Men would with Modeſty and Humility bring their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Sentiments to comply with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and not induſtriouſly ſtruggle to force the Scriptures to comply with their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate Opinions or Surmiſes. For, in a Thing of that Depth and Counſel, as is the Redemption of Mankind, I am ſure it is much more <hi>ſafe,</hi> as well as more <hi>modeſt,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Declarations of God, whoſe Counſel and Work it is, (and that too eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, where, as we have ſeen, a ſober and modeſt Reaſon falls in with, and approves ſuch his Declarations) than by a more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned way of Reaſoning, and a more tedious and intricate Deduction of Conſequences,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49679:82"/>(where any little Flaw or Miſtake may ſpoil the whole Concatenation, and at long run determine in Deceit and Fallacy) downright to controul and contradict ſuch Declarations. For, God is our beſt and moſt ſure Guide in all things: And then, when he profeſſedly undertakes to be ſo, and that too in ſuch Things, that our Natural Reaſon knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, without ſuch his Guidance; it would be the beſt Uſe that we can poſſibly make of ſuch our Reaſon, in all ſuch Caſes to follow his Conduct. For, in this very Caſe, God has himſelf told us, that he has <hi>confounded the Wiſdom of the Wiſe.</hi> For, <hi>Chriſt crucified was to the Jews a Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block, and to the Greeks Fooliſhneſs.</hi> And it has before our Days been thought very good Reaſon, that he therefore could not ſave <hi>others,</hi> becauſe he could not ſave <hi>himſelf.</hi> Tho' I cannot perſuade my ſelf to doubt, but that That, and all other Methods of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that attempt to make out the Injuſtice of his Suffering in our ſtead, or any other ways to evacuate the Merit and Purchaſe of his Blood, will in the concluſion prove frivolous and empty; and that they will be found light, even in the Balance of Reaſon it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But to carry this Buſineſs a little farther: As we have made it out, that ſober and ſound Reaſon will warrant the Juſtice of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, if it was ſo managed, as we have laid it down; ſo, that it was ſo managed, we
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49679:83"/>may be as much aſſured by the Word of God, as we may of any other Thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Word. And hence we are told, that God made our Saviour to <hi>become Sin for us, who knew no Sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> That <hi>he reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the Eighteenth Verſe of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: He tells us alſo, that <hi>he was reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes unto them,</hi> in the Verſe immediately following. And that we may be aſſured, that God does all this in Conſideration of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Death and Paſſion, we are told in one Place, that <hi>he died for our Sins;</hi> in another, that <hi>the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin;</hi> in a third, that <hi>being juſtified by his Blood, we ſhall be ſaved from Wrath through him.</hi> All which, with a great deal more to the ſame import, that might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, amounts to thus much; That our Saviour took upon himſelf our Sins, and in our ſtead died for them; and that thereupon God pardoned ſuch our Sins, and was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us. Now, becauſe <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>tells</hi> us ſuch a thing, and that too in as plain and expreſs Words, as any thing can poſſibly be told in, we may be very ſure, that what is ſo told, is plain and open <hi>Truth:</hi> And becauſe at the ſame time he <hi>tells</hi> us, that what was ſo done, was done by <hi>himſelf;</hi> we may more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over be ſure, that what was ſo done, was <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>right.</hi> However, thus far we are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49679:83"/>certain, that if in the preſent Caſe we will be contented to be determined by the Word of God, that then there neither are, nor can be any Laws of Juſtice, that can hinder our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Suffering in our ſtead, in order to our obtaining the Pardon of our Sins by ſuch his Suffering.</p>
                     <p>The Anſwer then to what ſhall be alledged againſt ſuch Juſtice, we ſhall defer to the next Chapter. Only before we break off here, we cannot but take notice, that the Doctrine of our Saviour's Expiation, as it <hi>has</hi> in part already, and will more fully here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after appear to have more <hi>Truth</hi> in it, than what is alledged againſt it; ſo alſo it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have more <hi>Comfort.</hi> For, if there be no other Name, whereby we muſt be ſaved; it muſt needs be very imprudent at leaſt to refuſe to admit our own Salvation in and by him: And it is a Doubt at leaſt, whether they, who deny his Expiation, the Purchaſe of his Blood, and the Forgiveneſs of Sins in Conſideration of his Death, do not ſo refuſe it. And it is at leaſt another Doubt, whether thoſe, who refuſe it upon ſuch Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do not refuſe it altogether. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do at leaſt ſeem to tell us ſo: And they will give but an ill Account of their Prudence, who will ſo far hazard their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to gratifie their Obſtinacy in an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that does ſo palpably controul God's expreſs Declarations.</p>

                           <hi>Anſwers to Three Objections.</hi> 1. <hi>The Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in Juſtice only due to us, not to him. This Objection retorted upon the</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians. 2. <hi>That his Death was but a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhment; but the Expiation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be made, was of an Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> 3. <hi>The Abſurdity, that God ſhould ſuffer for the Satisfaction of his own Juſtice.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT notwithſtanding the Multitudes of ſuch Declarations in his Word, which do avowedly and profeſſedly acquaint us with this great Truth; yet for all that, it has met with many Adverſaries: Who, as they have endeavoured by odd and very uncouth Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations to expound away the plain and categorical Aſſertions of ſuch Declarations; ſo have they alſo to back ſuch their Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Arguments taken from Natural Reaſon. Now it may be reaſonably expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thoſe Reaſons ſhould be very good, and well-grounded, which pretend to make good ſuch an Interpretation of God's Word, which at firſt View is a downright Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſuch Word. And becauſe all thoſe Interpretations, which attempt to annul the Expiatory Sacrifice of our Saviour, are ſuch; therefore, before we proceed any farther, we
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49679:84"/>cannot but take notice, that it looks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous at leaſt to <hi>pretend</hi> to <hi>meaſure,</hi> and much more is it ſo, to <hi>controul</hi> the Juſtice of the Divine Counſels and Actions, laid down expreſly and frequently in his acknowledged Word, by ſo uncertain a Standard as Humane Reaſon; becauſe it is impoſſible, that ſuch Reaſon ſhould comprehend all Poſſibilities; eſpecially ſuch, which are confeſſedly brought to paſs by the more ſignal and extraordinary Power of an Omnipotent Arm. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, becauſe ſuch Attempts have been made, we will conſider <hi>ſome,</hi> and the <hi>chief</hi> too, of thoſe Allegations which have been offered in oppoſition to thoſe plain and expreſs Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, that God in his Word has made to Man, of the Method of his own Proceedings in the Forgiveneſs of their Sins.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, It is pleaded againſt the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of our Saviour's Suffering in order to the obtaining of our Pardon, That ſuch Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings cannot therefore be juſt, becauſe in Juſtice and Equity they are due to <hi>us,</hi> and not to <hi>him.</hi> For, ſince the Juſtice of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment muſt ariſe from the Demerit of the Delinquent, the Puniſhment can in Juſtice be only laid on there, where the Demerit is lodged. And therefore, if our Saviour was not the <hi>Sinner,</hi> (as moſt certainly he was not) neither ought he in Juſtice to be the <hi>Sufferer.</hi> And to confirm this Way of Arguing, we have the Voice of God himſelf aſſuring us,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49679:85"/>that <hi>the Father ſhall not ſuffer for the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Son, nor the Son for the Iniquity of the Father,</hi> (that is, one Soul ſhall not ſuffer for the Sins of another) <hi>but the Soul that ſinneth, that ſhall die,</hi> in the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> And, which is yet a great deal more, God does there appeal to the Senſe of Mankind for the Equity and Juſtice of ſuch his Proceedings. Now then, if every Sinner ought in Juſtice to bear his own Burden, how can it poſſibly be juſt, that the Puniſhment of our Sins ſhould be laid upon another, who was in no wiſe guilty of thoſe Sins? And then, laſtly, if the Vengeance due to our Sins could not in Juſtice be laid upon another; then neither can it be true, that God does therefore remit ſuch Vengeance to us, becauſe our Saviour has ſuffered in our ſtead. And by conſequence, the Forgiveneſs of our Sins cannot either in Reaſon or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice depend upon our Saviour's Sufferings. And if it does not, then it muſt be a Miſtake at leaſt to affirm, that God's Forgiveneſs of our Sins is juſt and equal; and yet at the ſame time to maintain, that he does forgive them in Conſideration of our Saviour's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. The Objection (you ſee) looks plauſible at the firſt ſight; but yet, when it comes to be ſtrictly examined, will (as will appear by and by) ſignifie juſt nothing. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is no doubt made by any of Mankind, that we know of, but that in ſome
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49679:85"/>Caſes one may become a Surety for another; and that if the Principal fails in the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his juſt Obligations, the Surety (ſo far as he ſtands bound for him) is obliged in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to anſwer and make good ſuch Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This among Mankind is taken as a Thing granted in all thoſe Pecuniary Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which do relate to Commerce or Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick: And therefore it is generally allowed, that he who is bound for the Payment of another Man's Debt, upon default of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the original Debtor, does become Debtor himſelf, and, as ſuch, is bound in Juſtice to make good the Debt to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor.</p>
                     <p>Nay, we may go farther yet, and by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, may advance one Step nearer to our main Deſign. For, as all Mankind are agreed, that the Surety ſtands bound in Juſtice to pay the Debt, upon the Non-payment of the Principal Debtor, where ſuch Debt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by <hi>Commerce</hi> or <hi>Traffick;</hi> ſo alſo they have the ſame Senſe of the Surety's Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Debt is contracted by the Principal Debtor's <hi>Crime</hi> or <hi>Delinquency.</hi> Now it is agreed on all Hands (for Common Senſe tells all Men ſo) that a Debt contracted by a Crime is a Puniſhment, tho' it be but a pecuniary Puniſhment. And then, if a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon the Failure in the Principal, be bound in Juſtice to pay <hi>ſuch</hi> a Debt; it will be ſo far from being a Doubt, whether a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49679:86"/>Surety in ſuch a Caſe may juſtly undergo the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of the Criminal; that in deed and truth he is bound, and that too in Juſtice and Honeſty, to undergo it. From whence we conclude, in the firſt place, that it is ſo far from being abſolutely true, that one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot <hi>juſtly</hi> ſuffer the Puniſhment due to the <hi>Crimes</hi> of another; that, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it may ſo happen, that he may be <hi>bound,</hi> and that too in <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf ſuch Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To which we add, in the ſecond place, That in ſuch a Caſe, where one Perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes the Puniſhment due to the Crimes of another, the Puniſhment ſo inflicted can ſo much the leſs be taxed of Injuſtice, if the Perſon, who undergoes it, do undertake it <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>willingly.</hi> And therefore, tho' it be true <hi>in Theſi,</hi> that is, in the general, that it is Injuſtice to puniſh an Innocent Man for the Fault of a Criminal; yet <hi>in Hypotheſi,</hi> or in a particular Matter of Fact, it may not be unjuſt ſo to do. And the Reaſon is, becauſe any Puniſhment (be it what it will) can only be unjuſt with relation to that Perſon who undergoes ſuch Puniſhment. For, if he does juſtly undergo it, then, let the Puniſhment be what it will, yet ſtill it will be juſt. Now, where a Perſon does willingly, freely, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his own accord ſubmit to a Puniſhment; there the Puniſhment, tho' he did not by his Crimes deſerve it, cannot therefore be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49679:86"/>thought unjuſt, becauſe it would be an odd and unheard-of kind of Injuſtice to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to injure him by ſulfilling his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and by gratifying his Choice. If then we apply this to our Saviour's Sufferings, which he underwent in our ſtead, we may be informed by him himſelf, that <hi>he laid down his Life,</hi> and, that <hi>no Man took it from him;</hi> that is, he laid it down willingly. And becauſe he did ſo, therefore tho' God laid upon him, and accepted from him the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance due to our Sins, in order to our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance; yet he did him no Injury by ſo doing, becauſe he was willing, as our Surety and Proxy, to undergo and ſuffer ſuch Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Indeed it is not to diſſembled, that becauſe the Sin was <hi>Ours,</hi> and not <hi>His,</hi> that God therefore might, and that juſtly too, have refuſed the Puniſhment to <hi>be his,</hi> and not <hi>ours.</hi> But then, withal, we muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that tho' God <hi>might</hi> have done ſo; yet that there was no Law of Juſtice, that either did or could <hi>oblige</hi> him ſo to do. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to clear that, or any other Doubt that may ariſe from what has been ſpoken upon this Head, we add,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the third place, That where that Perſon, who willingly ſuffers for another's Crime, has an undoubted <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title in</hi> all thoſe Things, and an <hi>uncontroulable Power</hi> to diſpoſe <hi>of</hi> all thoſe Things, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>damnified</hi> or <hi>loſt</hi> by ſuch his Sufferings:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49679:87"/>In ſuch a Caſe, as there is no Injury done to his <hi>Perſon,</hi> by reaſon of his <hi>willingneſs</hi> to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; ſo neither is there any Violence offered to any <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> by reaſon of ſuch his <hi>undoubted Right,</hi> and <hi>abſolute Power.</hi> Now at once to clear this Matter, and to bring it up to the Point we aim at, we muſt take notice, that our Saviour tells us himſelf, in the Tenth of St. <hi>John</hi> and the Eighteenth Verſe, <hi>I have power to lay down my Life, and I have power to take it again.</hi> And Reaſon tells us the ſame Thing: For, becauſe <hi>he made the Worlds,</hi> and becauſe <hi>all things were created by him and for him,</hi> and becauſe for theſe Reaſons alone he is the Almighty God; therefore there can be no queſtion, but that he may juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to himſelf that Power, which the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God claims, as his moſt undoubted Prerogative, <hi>I kill, and I make alive.</hi> To which we may likewiſe add, that he is to be <hi>Judge both of Quick and Dead</hi> (as even that <hi>Creed,</hi> which goes by the Name of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> and even our Adverſaries too, in the preſent Caſe, do allow.) Now it cannot in the leaſt ſeem reaſonable, that he ſhould have the Power of <hi>Damning</hi> and <hi>Saving,</hi> who has not the Power of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> For, it muſt needs ſound harſh to our Reaſon, to <hi>grant</hi> him the <hi>greater</hi> Power, and in the mean time to <hi>deny</hi> him the <hi>leſs.</hi> Taking it therefore for granted, that he had an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and uncontroulable Power to diſpoſe of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49679:87"/>his Life as it ſeemed beſt to his own Wiſdom; if he was pleaſed ſo to diſpoſe of ſuch his Life, as to lay it down in our ſtead, and for our ſakes, there could not poſſibly lie any Obligation of Juſtice upon God, to bind him up from accepting the Offer of ſuch his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; becauſe ſuch a Power does in it ſelf ſuppoſe, that there neither is, nor can be any Injury, that ſhould forbid ſuch an Offering. And we know well enough, that any thing may be lawfully done, againſt the doing of which there is no juſt Law. And therefore the Caſe of our Saviour, in the preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, does ſo far forth differ from all the Caſes of all other imaginary Innocents in the World. For, tho' another Man be ſuppoſed to be Innocent, yet he has no ſuch Power over his own Life, as to diſpoſe of it as he himſelf ſhall pleaſe: And if he ſhould by any Means deſtroy it without his own Demerit, it would be in him Self-murder, and that too, tho' he ſhould offer it for a Criminal. But if he ſhould ſo order his Life, as to deſerve Death; then that very Crime, that forfeits his Life, would ſpoil his Innocence too. And therefore ſhould a Magiſtrate, who is inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the lawful Power of the Sword, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Life of an Innocent in lieu of the forfeited Life of a Criminal, he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore become a Criminal himſelf; becauſe in ſuch a Commutation he allows the Innocent Man to become a Criminal, by uſurping upon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49679:88"/>the Prerogative of God himſelf. Which may ſerve to ſhew the Fraud and Deceit of that way of Arguing, which will not therefore allow it to be juſt, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhould offer his Life, as a Sacrifice for Sinners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be juſtly allowed, that <hi>other</hi> Innocent Perſons ſhould do ſo: Whereas the Life, which our Saviour offered in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, was entirely his <hi>own,</hi> and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his own <hi>diſpoſal;</hi> which yet cannot be truly affirmed of the Life of any <hi>other</hi> Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſon in the World (if yet we ſhould ſuppoſe ſuch a Perſon) from the Days of the Creation, to the Conſummation of all Things. As therefore we learned by the <hi>laſt</hi> Head, that God might have <hi>refuſed</hi> to accept our Saviour's Death in our ſtead; becauſe the Life offered was not the <hi>ſame</hi> that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, but <hi>another:</hi> So, by what has been ſpoken under <hi>that</hi> Head, and <hi>this,</hi> we may now perceive, that there is no Reaſon in Law or Juſtice, why he might <hi>not</hi> accept it. For, if our Saviour might have become Surety for the Diſcharge of that Debt, which by the Tenor of the Law we owed to Juſtice, by our Tranſgreſſion of the Law; and if, upon our Inability to pay ſuch Debt, ſo as to obtain our Acquittance, he was willing, and fully impowered to lay down his Life, in order to our Releaſe and Diſcharge; and if God might in Juſtice accept the Offering of ſuch his Life for ſo gracious and merciful a Purpoſe: Then
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49679:88"/>the whole Objection againſt the Juſtice of his Suffering in our ſtead, and for our ſake, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, and comes to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Things I have purſued thus far, to put the whole Matter in a true Light, and to lay it down juſt as it is: Tho' I do frankly confeſs, that I do not think the Objection againſt our Saviour's Sufferings, taken from the Injuſtice of ſuch Sufferings, to be of any force at all, no not upon thoſe very Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, upon which they go, who make it. For, they themſelves allow our Saviour to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and by conſequence (tho' they make Death a Natural Thing, which, by the way, is but an Heathen-Notion of it; for it does not in the leaſt agree with what the Scriptures teach us about it:) But, I ſay, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves allow our Saviour to be <hi>innocent;</hi> and therefore they muſt allow, that he did not <hi>deſerve</hi> that Death, which he ſuffered. But then they tell us, that God did therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to undergo ſuch a cruel and hard Treatment, that he might be an Example of Patience, Submiſſion, and Reſignation, to all Men, in any Circumſtances, under which they ſhould be brought by God's Providence; and that he was ſlain a Sacrifice to ratifie and eſtabliſh the New-Covenant, that God then made with Man in order to the Pardon of Sin. By which it is notorious, that they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to vindicate God's Juſtice from thoſe Ends and Deſigns of his Providence or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49679:89"/>for which God delivered up his Son to a cruel and bloody Death, tho' he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch Death.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Now we are very well aſſured, in the firſt place, that our Saviour was <hi>delivered up to be crucified and ſlain, by the determinate Counſel and Foreknowledge of God.</hi> For ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly tells us, in the Second of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the Twenty third Verſe. And again, we are told in the Fourth of the <hi>Acts</hi> the Twenty ſeventh and Twenty eighth Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that <hi>Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the People of Iſrael, were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, to do to him, whatſoever God's Hand and Counſel determined before to be done.</hi> We know alſo, that his Crucifixion was propheſied in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and that in ſundry Places; and that he himſelf does both foretell it in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and does there alſo tell us, that it was plentifully fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the <hi>Old.</hi> And we know, laſtly, that what was foretold ſome thouſand Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was brought to paſs, and then was ſo actually brought to paſs, as it was foretold, muſt be foretold by God: The Certainty of the Event, in ſuch a Caſe, being a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that Omniſcience gave forth the Prediction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We are aſſured, in the ſecond place, that our Saviour being perfectly Innocent, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never tranſgreſſed the Law, could not poſſibly <hi>deſerve</hi> the Death of the moſt hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49679:89"/>Malefactors, a Death attended with Agony and Torment, tho' he did <hi>ſuffer</hi> ſuch a Death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is agreed, in the third place, between us and our Adverſaries, That becauſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did willingly ſubmit to the Counſel and Determination of God, in ſuffering ſuch a Death; that thereby God's Juſtice is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently aſſoiled and vindicated (to which we ſpake more largely juſt now) and that by ſuch his Submiſſion he gave an Example to Mankind, under any Affliction, of an entire Reſignation to the Counſel and Will of God, in all Caſes whatſoever.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But then, in the laſt place, it may be reaſonably demanded, how it comes to paſs, that theſe ſelf-ſame Sufferings, this ſelf-ſame Death of our Saviour, do then become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, when they are affirmed to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone by him for the Expiation of Man's Sin? They were juſt, becauſe he underwent them willingly; and they were honourable, becauſe they were exemplary; and we are ſure they were merciful and charitable, if they were expiatory: And then, ſhall what is juſt in it ſelf, and honourable, becauſe it is deſigned for an Example, or for any other End; I ſay, ſhall ſuch a Thing therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unjuſt, becauſe it is over and above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for a Charity and a Mercy? The ſame Thing (we know) may be directed to more Ends and Purpoſes than one; and thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49679:90"/>Ends and Purpoſes may all be good and warrantable; and where they are ſo, there (if the Thing be good and juſt in it ſelf) we may in Reaſon reſt ſatisfied, that one of thoſe good Endswill no more vitiate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it, than any other End will. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Death of our Saviour were juſt <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> being deſign'd for an Expiation; it will remain juſt ſtill, tho' it <hi>be</hi> deſign'd for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Expiation. For, Mercy and Compaſſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> (which are undoubtedly included in ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation) are moſt undoubtedly juſt and good Things, when they are deſigned and brought to paſs by juſt and lawful Means. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Adverſaries of the Expiation do tell us, that the <hi>Death</hi> of our Saviour was juſt and lawful, they do with the ſame Mouth-full of Breath contradict their own Objection againſt the Juſtice of the Expiation; and do as good as tell us, that the <hi>Expiation</hi> is juſt and lawful too. When therefore <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> and his Followers, do in very tragical Expreſſions (and ſome of thoſe Expreſnons ſo indecent and irreverent, to ſay no worſe, as not fit to be mentioned) exclaim againſt the Injuſtice of the Expiation; it is notorious, that they <hi>quit</hi> their <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>fly</hi> to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue;</hi> that is, they hope in this Caſe to prevail by their <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> rather than by their <hi>Arguments.</hi> For, I can hardly perſuade my ſelf to believe them ſo ſhort-ſighted, as not to perceive, that any Argument againſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49679:90"/>the Juſtice of the Expiation does not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ſuch their own Poſitions, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Juſtice of our Saviour's Death and Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>One Thing more I would remark, and then I ſhall proceed; and that is, That becauſe the Objection under this Head is only laid againſt the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but not at all againſt the <hi>Value, Merit,</hi> or <hi>extenſive Influence</hi> of our Saviour's Death; therefore I have preciſely ſtuck to the Matter of the preſent Objection, without mixing other Things with it relating to the Expiation; that is, I have here only aſſerted the Juſtice of our Saviour's Death, in order to the Expiation of the Sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond Objection againſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Expiation of our Sins by his Death, ſtands thus: and that is, That tho' it ſhould be granted, that he had Power over his own Life, that he was willing to lay down that Life, and that God was willing to accept it; yet all this will amount but to <hi>part</hi> of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For, firſt, the Death that we deſerved by our Sins was <hi>Eternal;</hi> but that which he ſuffered in our ſtead, was but <hi>Tranſient</hi> and <hi>Temporal.</hi> It is confeſſed, that as the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do deny the Expiation, ſo do they alſo an Etern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty of Puniſhment: But yet that does not at all take off from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orce of the Objection; becauſe if they, who maintain the Doctrine of the Expiation, do alſo aſſert
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49679:91"/>an Eternity of Puniſhment, it is ſufficient for their Confutation to ſhew, that their ſeveral Doctrines do contradict, and ſo overthrow each other. The Objection then being ſo far laid right, it goes on further, thus: The Sins of Mankind are the Sins of Many, of Thouſands, of Millions, of Myriads, nay, of Multitudes of Myriads; but the Death of our Saviour was only the Death of One: So that if either we conſider the <hi>Extent</hi> of our Guilt, or the <hi>Malignity</hi> of it, it will by no means ſeem reaſonable, and therefore neither juſt, that the ſingle Death of our Saviour ſhould be looked upon as a proportionats Expiation of it. Nor indeed would it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe who make the Objection; who (tho' the Apoſtle tells us in one Place, that <hi>in him dwells all the Fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily;</hi> and in another Place, that <hi>being in the Form of God, he thought it no Robbery to be equal with God</hi>) will yet, in ſpite of theſe, and a Multitude of other expreſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations to the contrary, ſtill allow our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be no more than a mere Man. Now it is freely confeſſed, that if the Caſe were ſo, then his ſingle Death would be no valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Compenſation for the Death of <hi>all</hi> the Sinners in the World; and much leſs would it be ſo for the <hi>eternal</hi> Death of ſuch Sinners. But ſince the Scriptures have over and over told us, that his Death was ſuch a Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and ſince ſuch a Compenſation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49679:91"/>not exceed the Dignity of that Character, which the ſame Scriptures have given us of him, tho' their Way of Reaſoning ſays o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; I dare leave it to any ſober <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> to judge, whether it does not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them to anſwer what the Scriptures do object to <hi>them,</hi> than it does us, in the preſent Caſe, to anſwer what they do object to <hi>us.</hi> For, if the Fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in our Saviour bodily, and ſo was united to and with that Body; then it will be no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Strain to imagine, that the Infinite Dignity of the Perſon ſuffering muſt needs add an immenſe Value to ſuch his Sufferings, and by ſo doing muſt make them more than adequate to the Guilt of all Mankind. And tho' this of it ſelf may be ſufficient to ſtop the Mouth of the preſent Objection; yet if we do but recollect ſome few Things, that have been ſpoken to, and made good already, we may ſtill be farther ſatisfied, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Value of his Sufferings, in order to the Expiation of the Sins of Men, will be of no force at all. If we do conſider therefore, that becauſe our Saviour took on him the Nature of <hi>Man,</hi> and not of <hi>Angels,</hi> that he did therefore <hi>die</hi> for Men and not for Angels: If we conſider, that the <hi>faln Angels</hi> are left without any hope of Eſcape from the Vengeance of the final Judgment, which <hi>Man</hi> is not: If we conſider, that the Vengeance which the faln Angels ſhall then ſuffer, will
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49679:92"/>
                        <hi>never</hi> work out their Redemption, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs; and that for that very Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Vengeance ſhall be <hi>eternal:</hi> If we conſider, that neither would eternal Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance work out the Salvation of any <hi>Man,</hi> for the ſame Reaſon: And laſtly, If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that notwithſtanding the utter Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Man's ſatisfying the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by his own Puniſhment: yet we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the Voice of God, that ſome Men ſhall obtain Redemption by their Saviour's Blood, even Reminion of Sins: I ſay, if we con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>der all theſe Things, our Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will help us to conclude, that the Death of our Saviour, tho it were but the Death of <hi>One,</hi> and tho' it were but a <hi>temporal</hi> Death neither, yet will do that, which all the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deaths in the World could not do; that is, it will reconcile Sinners to God, and from him obtain their Pardon; and that upon that ſingle Account, it is of more Value in his Signt, than the Death of Angels and Men; and that therefore he, who ſuffered that Death, was infinitely greater than both. By which we may alſo underſtand, that if there be any Abſurdity in the thing, that one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by his ſingle and temporal Death, ſhould ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice for the Sins and Demerits of ſo many; they, who make the Objection, do make the Abſurdity too; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in their Opinion concerning the Perſon ſuffering, they do degrade him below that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49679:92"/>Infinite Station and Dignity, in which the Scriptures do aſſure us, that he ſtands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The laſt Objection againſt our Saviour's Expiation of Sin, and that which does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rather attempt to prove the <hi>Impoſſibility,</hi> than the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> of the Thing, is this; That if our Saviour be God himſelf, and if this very Saviour did die to reconcile Sinners to God; then it will follow, That God ſuffered to reconcile Sinners to himſelf: Which, at at the very firſt ſight, looks abſurd.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And ſo it may indeed, to Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which in many other Things, but more eſpecially in the Things of God, is very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten guided by dark and blind Meaſures. But ſtill the Apoſtle twice tells us, in the Second to the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. That <hi>God</hi> was reconciling us, and reconciling the World to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and that he did this by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom yet the ſame Apoſtle in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place calls, <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever.</hi> Now, in the Contrivance and Enterpriſe of this Reconciliation, he was the firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent; and ſo indeed the very Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reconciliation came from the offended Perſon: Nay, it was he, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the whole Method of Reconciliation; (for, <hi>it was hid from Ages and Generations, from Principalities and Powers,</hi> till God made it known to his Church.) And that we may not think, that there is any Abſurdity in this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49679:93"/>his doing, he does in this very Caſe, as far as our Circumſtances will allow, command us to follow his Example. For, in the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and the Fifteenth Verſe, he requires, that <hi>if our Brother offend us,</hi> we (that is, we the <hi>Offended</hi>) <hi>ſhould go and tell him his Fault.</hi> So that, tho' the Injury be done, not <hi>by</hi> us, but <hi>to</hi> us; yet <hi>we</hi> muſt make the firſt Step towards a Reconciliation. Now, a Man of a worldly Reaſon would in this Caſe be apt to cry out, What! muſt I begin to give my ſelf Satisfaction? Is this Senſe or Juſtice? Did not he do the Injury? And is not the whole Reparation to come from him? But, <hi>God's Thoughts are not as Man's Thoughts, nor his Ways as Man's Ways.</hi> And therefore, tho' your <hi>Enemy</hi> began the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;</hi> yet, if he commands, <hi>you</hi> muſt begin the <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> And if God do not only <hi>begin</hi> the Reconciliation in the Caſe before us, but alſo <hi>ſuffer</hi> himſelf, that he may compleat it; all the Inconvenience that will follow from it, will be, that God can do more than Man: For, he can do any thing, that is not <hi>unjuſt;</hi> and any thing, that is not <hi>impoſſible.</hi> And, as we have already made it out, that it is not unjuſt; ſo we ſhall go on farther, to make it out, that it is not impoſſible.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For, ſecondly, our Saviour being (as we have already made it out) a Middle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon between God and Man, a Mediator in his <hi>Perſon,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Office;</hi> as he was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49679:93"/>
                        <hi>not</hi> ſo <hi>Man,</hi> but that he <hi>was God;</hi> ſo he was <hi>not</hi> ſo <hi>God,</hi> but that he <hi>was Man.</hi> And then, if we add, that as <hi>Man</hi> he ſuffered for the Sins of <hi>Man,</hi> ſo much may be allowed now, becauſe ſo much has been proved already. And indeed, ſtrictly and cloſely ſpeaking, it was <hi>Man,</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> who ſuffered in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Saviour. For God, we are ſure, is utterly, and in his own Nature, incapable of any ſuch Thing, as that is, which we call Suffering. So far forth therefore as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection furmiſes, that we take God to have ſuffered; ſo far the Objection is miſtaken and laid wrong. But yet,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe God and Man were perſonally united in our Saviour, and ſo made up but one <hi>Chriſt;</hi> therefore our Reaſon will tell us, that the Sufferings of ſuch a Man muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an immenſe Value from his Perſonal Union with God. Take the Thing in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and it will be much more plain, and ſatisfactory. A Man ſtrikes a Prince. No one will ſay, that he ſtrikes his <hi>Dignity,</hi> (for the thing is impoſſible) but only his <hi>Body.</hi> But yet to think, that the Injury and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Stroke ſhall not be rated, as well by his <hi>Dignity,</hi> as by his <hi>Body,</hi> would be an Imagination, that an ordinary Reaſon would condemn of Weakneſs. And therefore, tho' the Bodies of all Men are made of the ſame Fleſh and Blood, and ſo the wounding of a <hi>Prince</hi> is no greater a natural Hurt to <hi>him,</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:49679:94"/>than the wounding of a <hi>Peaſant</hi> is to <hi>him,</hi> (ſuppoſing their Wounds to be equal or alike) yet we know, that the Difference of their <hi>Conditions</hi> ſhall make ſuch a vaſt Difference in the <hi>Value</hi> of the Miſchiefs done by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Wounds; that, in the <hi>firſt</hi> Caſe, the Fault of ſuch Miſchief ſhall be eſteem'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital;</hi> when perhaps in the laſt it ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thought <hi>Penal.</hi> The Sufferings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> might be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Expiation of the Sins of Mankind, not becauſe his Deity <hi>ſuffer'd</hi> with his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; but becauſe he being <hi>IMMANU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EL,</hi> his Deity gave an <hi>Infinite Value</hi> to the Sufferings of his Humanity, by being Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, becauſe Perſonally, united to it. And therefore, as my Reaſon ſuggeſts to me the Certainty of the Union of his Deity with his Humanity, from the Expiation made by the Value of the Sufferings of his Humanity; ſo from the Union of his Deity with his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it rather ſuggeſts to me, that he is One Perſon of the Deity, than that his Deity ſuffer'd for the accompliſhing of ſuch his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation. And I cannot but think, that the Arguments already offered will in a good meaſure warrant ſuch a Suggeſtion: And therefore, to what has been already ſaid, I add in the</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourth place, That tho' the Expiation of the Sin of Man was <hi>one</hi> Deſign both of our Saviour's Incarnation and Sufferings; yet
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49679:94"/>that it was not the <hi>whole</hi> Deſign of ſuch his Sufferings, and of ſuch his Incarnation. For, he came <hi>to deſtroy the Works of the Devil;</hi> the Kingdom, which the Devil had ſet up in this lower World; to recover ſinful Man from that Revolt that he had made from God, and ſo to reſtore him to his Duty and Allegiance to his Sovereign Lord and King (as will appear more fully hereafter.) And to this purpoſe, as it was neceſſary, that he ſhould <hi>purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works;</hi> ſo it was neceſſary, that he ſhould free ſuch People from that State of Sin, in which they were in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and by doing both, eſtabliſh a Kingdom of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, in lieu of a Kingdom of Sin and Darkneſs. His grand Deſign then was the <hi>enlarging</hi> of his Father's Kingdom, by reſtoring to it what the Devil had torn off from him. And then, if for the <hi>accompliſhing</hi> of ſuch his Deſign, the <hi>Expiation</hi> of Man's Sin; and if for the <hi>Expiation</hi> of Man's Sin his <hi>own Death</hi> was neceſſary; it will be no great ſtrain to conceive, that the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> united to the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, ſhould do and ſuffer what he did, for the fulfilling the Will of God, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring and ſo enlarging his Kingdom, by ſubdu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng his Arch-enemy, and by taking his uſurped Dominion out of his Hand, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting it to himſelf. For, all this our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did, when by thoſe Methods, with which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49679:95"/>the eternal Wiſdom has acquainted us in his Word, he builds up a Kingdom of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs out of one of Rebellion and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Which Kingdom, when his Work is fully accompliſhed, he will (which was his main and grand Deſign) reſign up to God, the natural and rightful Lord of all Kingdom and Dominion: See 1 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. Tho' therefore our Apprehenſions may be ſtartled, when we undertake to conceive, that the Son of God, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Word of God, by whom he made the Worlds, ſhould ſuffer to reconcile Man (who had made himſelf his Enemy by Sin) to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in order to Man's Pardon: Yet when we conſider, that by the ſame Undertaking, he re-ſettled his Father's Kingdom, aſſerted his Honour and Dignity, diſplayed his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and in Conjunction with that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Juſtice; and that by doing all this, he exhibited God to the World, not only a faithful Creator, but alſo a gracious and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Redeemer: I ſay, when all theſe Things are conſidered, our Wonder and our Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may not only <hi>abate,</hi> but <hi>ceaſe;</hi> and we may be rationally ſatisfied, that it was as well worth our Saviour's Sufferings, to bring all theſe Things to paſs, (tho his Enemy Man had his Intereſt in it) as it was for him to make Man at firſt.</p>
                     <p>Now, what we have ſaid, is a ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objection, upon ſuppoſition, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49679:95"/>any or every Sin is of ſo malignant a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the juſt Puniſhment of it ſhall be Eternal. But tho' there be ſuch a Thing, as Eternal Puniſhment, moſt expreſly aſſerted by the Scriptures, (and therefore we do by no means queſtion the Truth of it) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Socinians</hi> may pretend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; yet perhaps it is not ſo certain, that the Scriptures do allot any <hi>ſuch</hi> Puniſhment to any <hi>other</hi> Sin beſides <hi>Unbelief,</hi> or (which amounts to much the ſame Thing, tho' in other Words) a <hi>final Impenitence.</hi> For, it is moſt certain, that all <hi>other</hi> Sins, if they be truly and heartily repented for, ſhall, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our Saviour's Merits, be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;</hi> and it is as certain, that no Man ſhall undergo an eternal Puniſhment for <hi>thoſe</hi> Sins, which ſhall be <hi>forgiven.</hi> If therefore we do aſſert, what is moſt true, that our Saviour did not die to ſave Unbelievers, or Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners; and that they are the <hi>only</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to whom <hi>eternal</hi> Puniſhments are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; in ſuch a Caſe, the Objection, that his <hi>temporal</hi> Puniſhment could not take away an <hi>eternal</hi> Puniſhment, would be of no force; becauſe, in ſuch Caſe, <hi>eternal</hi> Puniſhment was not <hi>deſigned</hi> to be taken away. For, every Unbeliever, and Impenitent Perſon, ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, notwithſtanding our Saviour's Death: And there do not want very good Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (and thoſe too in no wiſe diſagreeing to Scripture-Revelations) that the Sins of thoſe,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49679:96"/>whoſe Sins ſhall not be pardoned after the Reſurrection, ſhall have juſt ſo much Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they do in Juſtice deſerve, (be that more or leſs) but that ſuch their Puniſhment ſhall not <hi>therefore</hi> be eternal, becauſe ſuch their Sins did <hi>deſerve</hi> ſuch eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but becauſe they <hi>refuſed</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> thoſe eaſie Means, which God had provided in a Saviour, by a due Uſe of which they might have eſcaped all Puniſhment whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Now, becauſe it is abſurd to imagine, that our Saviour <hi>under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Much more might be offered upon this Occaſion; but this being ſufficient in this Place, I ſhall therefore here add no more.</p>

                     <p>And from the Whole, that has been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on this Subject, we do at laſt conclude, That a Releaſe from the Vengeance due to Sin by the Law, and purchaſed for Man by his Saviour the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who for Man's ſake made his Soul a Sacrifice for Sin, is a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> Pardon, and agreeable to the Meaſures of <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> and to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, becauſe the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin does imply in it a <hi>Deſert</hi> of Puniſhment in the Party <hi>forgiven;</hi> and becauſe the <hi>laying</hi> the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>he</hi> deſerves, upon <hi>another,</hi> is in effect a <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of that Puniſhment to <hi>him;</hi> and becauſe, laſtly, a <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of Puniſhment to the Party, which <hi>deſerves</hi> ſuch Puniſhment, may be truly accounted a <hi>Pardon</hi> of his Sin; (For, Pardon of Sin to any Party whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is neither more nor leſs, than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing or Freeing him from the Puniſhment due to his Sin:) Therefore, if, by what has been ſpoken, it has appeared, that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to <hi>our</hi> Sins was, <hi>without</hi> any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, tranſlated upon <hi>another,</hi> and that upon ſuch Tranſlation it cannot juſtly be exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </argument>
                     <p>THo' we have hitherto aſſerted the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of our Saviour's Sacrifice, for the Expiation and Pardon of Sin; yet it muſt be confeſſed, that <hi>bare Pardon of Sin,</hi> upon any Conſiderations whatſoever, (be thoſe Conſiderations never ſo valuable) yet can never in Reaſon or Juſtice make out a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Salvation.</hi> And therefore, we laid it down at the Beginning, that as, in order to a Goſpel-Salvation, there was firſt required an <hi>Expiation,</hi> and, in conſideration of ſuch Expiation, a <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin; ſo there is alſo
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49679:97"/>required a <hi>Reſtitution</hi> to Holineſs, and the <hi>Gift</hi> of Eternal Happineſs. For, becauſe God's Law (as every good Law beſides) does conſiſt of Two Parts; Firſt, the <hi>Directive,</hi> or what it requires to be obey'd; and, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Vindictive,</hi> or what upon Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it requires to be ſuffered: And becauſe Sin is the <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to, or <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the Law: Therefore, ſo far as we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the Juſtice of the Pardon of Sin, ſo far we have only diſcourſed of <hi>that</hi> Juſtice which concerns the <hi>Vindictive</hi> Part of the Law. But by doing <hi>that,</hi> we have not at all diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>that</hi> Juſtice, which concerns the <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> Part of the Law. And if, upon our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to follow ſuch Directions, God does, for any Reaſons whatſoever, <hi>forgive</hi> us the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which we incur by ſuch our Neglect, and <hi>nothing more;</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, that by <hi>ſuch</hi> a way of Proceeding, all Care of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective,</hi> which is indeed the <hi>principal</hi> Part of the Law, is <hi>thrown away.</hi> For, becauſe all Men are Sinners, that is, becauſe none do obey the Law; tho' God upon valuable Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do <hi>remit</hi> the Puniſhment to <hi>ſome,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of thoſe Sinners; yet ſtill it is certain, that the <hi>Duty</hi> enjoined by the Law remains <hi>undone</hi> by all. And I therefore ſay, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe it will notoriouſly appear by what follows, that the Pardon of Sin, that is, the <hi>Pardon</hi> of the Tranſgreſſionof the Law, (tho' ſuch Pardon be granted by God, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49679:98"/>obtained by us, in Conſideration of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Suffering in our ſtead) can never paſs for the <hi>Performance</hi> of the Directions of the Law; that is, can never paſs for that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which conſiſts in an Obedience to ſuch Directions; and therefore (as we ſhall ſee more fully hereafter) can never be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for our obtaining a Goſpel-Salvation, which includes in it an eternal <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and an eternal <hi>Happineſs,</hi> as well as the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin.</p>
                     <p>Now, that the <hi>Pardon</hi> of our <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the Law, can neither in Reaſon nor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice paſs for our <hi>Performance</hi> of the <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of the Law, will appear notorious from theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> does imply in the very Notion of it a <hi>Deſert</hi> of Puniſhment; and a <hi>Deſert</hi> of Puniſhment does imply in it the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the Directions of the Law. For, no Man can be <hi>truly forgiven,</hi> who does not <hi>juſtly deſerve</hi> to be <hi>puniſhed;</hi> and no Man can <hi>juſtly deſerve</hi> to be <hi>puniſhed,</hi> who does not <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> the <hi>Directions</hi> of the Law. Now, for the ſame Reaſon, and upon the ſame Account, to eſteem a Man <hi>Innocent,</hi> and yet a <hi>Criminal,</hi> muſt needs be abſurd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Contradiction. And then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Contradictions only one Part can be true; therefore, ſo ſure as we are, that he, who is truly <hi>forgiven,</hi> muſt be a <hi>Sinner,</hi> ſo ſure we are alſo, that he neither is, nor can be truly ſuppoſed to be <hi>Innocent.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49679:98"/>when God forgives, as it is ſuppoſed in Reaſon and Common Senſe, that he does forgive <hi>Sins,</hi> and is ſo expreſſed in general in the Scriptures; ſo it is ſuppoſed in the ſame Reaſon, and the ſame Common Senſe, that he does forgive thoſe Sins to <hi>Sinners.</hi> And therefore we cannot be ſuppoſed to have obeyed the Directions of the Law, upon the Account, that God does forgive us the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment threatned in the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nor can we be ſo, ſecondly, Becauſe ſhould we <hi>undergo</hi> the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> which the Law threatens; yet we could not by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever <hi>fulfil</hi> the <hi>Directions</hi> of the Law. For, it is notorious in it ſelf, that the <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> what the Law <hi>threatens,</hi> is not the <hi>doing</hi> what the Law <hi>commands.</hi> Now, it is certain, that the <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of that Puniſhment, which we have deſerved, can give us no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Title to Obedience, than our <hi>ſuffering</hi> ſuch Puniſhment could have done, had that Puniſhment <hi>not</hi> been forgiven. And it looks abſurd at firſt view, that <hi>Guilt</hi> ſhould conſiſt in the neglect of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and that <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Deſert,</hi> and therefore in Juſtice the <hi>Effect</hi> of our <hi>Guilt;</hi> and yet that <hi>Obedience</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Effect</hi> of our <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> That is, that Guilt, after one Remove, ſhould be the proper, and in a manner natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, becauſe juſt Cauſe of Duty. But, we may be therefore ſure, that it is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe we are told by God himſelf, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49679:99"/>there is a Puniſhment after this Life, which ſhall be Eternal; which yet would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if the ſuffering of Puniſhment were equivalent to a perfect Obedience to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Law: Which, becauſe for the Reaſon <hi>alledged,</hi> and for <hi>more,</hi> that <hi>might</hi> be alledged; it cannot be, therefore neither can the <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of ſuch Puniſhment be ſo. For, it is evident, that the <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of our Puniſhment can do no more towards the making us <hi>obedient,</hi> than the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> it ſelf could do, ſhould we <hi>undergo</hi> it. And therefore the Pardon of our Sins for the Sake of our Saviour's having ſuffered in our ſtead, does not of it ſelf ſuppoſe us to have fulfilled the Directions of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of our Sins does imply nothing more in it, than our <hi>Freedom</hi> from that Vengeance, which the <hi>Law</hi> has <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and which <hi>we</hi> have <hi>deſerved</hi> by our Tranſgreſſion of the Directions of it; and ſo does only free us from the <hi>vindictive</hi> Part of the Law: But does not, for that Reaſon, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title us to thoſe <hi>Rewards,</hi> which the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to thoſe who <hi>obey</hi> its <hi>Directions.</hi> Now, it is a very different Thing to be barely <hi>freed</hi> from the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of the Law, and to be <hi>entitled</hi> to the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Law; becauſe the Caſe may really ſo be put, as that a Man may <hi>obtain</hi> a <hi>Releaſe</hi> in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Caſe, and yet never be <hi>entitled</hi> to, or <hi>poſſeſs</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> in the <hi>Laſt.</hi> And in all Caſes (let them
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49679:99"/>be what they will) yet ſtill we are certain, that the <hi>Firſt</hi> can only in Reaſon, nay, in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, belong to <hi>thoſe,</hi> who have <hi>tranſgreſſed</hi> the Law; and that the <hi>Laſt</hi> can only in ſtrictneſs of Law belong to <hi>thoſe,</hi> who have <hi>obeyed</hi> the Law: And therefore, that the <hi>Firſt</hi> can be only Matter of <hi>Favour;</hi> whereas the <hi>Laſt</hi> may be Matter of <hi>Right.</hi> Now, if there be any <hi>Difference</hi> in the Two Caſes, then, let that Difference be lodged where it will, yet we are from thence aſſured, that the Caſes are not the <hi>ſame;</hi> and therefore, neither can the <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of our Sins upon the Account of our Saviour's ſuffering the Vengeance of the Law in our ſtead, be any Argument, that we have <hi>fulfilled</hi> the Directions of the Law.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, tho' it be affirmed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Learned Men, that we are ſufficiently entitled to Eternal Happineſs by the bare Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our Sins, in Conſideration of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Sufferings; and that for this Reaſon, becauſe when we are treated by God with <hi>Impunity,</hi> we are at the ſame time treated as <hi>Innocents;</hi> and that <hi>he,</hi> who is <hi>treated</hi> as an Innocent by <hi>God</hi> himſelf, (who cannot be miſtaken in the Caſe) muſt therefore needs <hi>be</hi> ſo.</p>
                     <p>Yet theſe Men, as they do not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh between an <hi>Innocent</hi> and a <hi>Saint;</hi> ſo neither do they between <hi>Impunity</hi> and a <hi>Reward.</hi> For, tho' our Saviour's Sufferings are meritorious of a <hi>Reward</hi> to <hi>himſelf,</hi> (and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49679:100"/>ſo the Scriptures tell us;) yet they are only <hi>expiatory</hi> to <hi>us;</hi> and that too in the Nature of the Thing. For, the utmoſt Deſign, the natural Tendency, and the only Buſineſs of an Expiation, is to obtain an <hi>Impunity</hi> for <hi>ſuch,</hi> who have <hi>deſerved,</hi> and therefore muſt in Juſtice, without ſuch an Expiation, <hi>ſuffer</hi> Puniſhment. But neither Scripture, Reaſon, or Juſtice will tell us, that a Purchaſe of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity</hi> from the Vengeance due to the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors</hi> of the Law, can be a Purchaſe of that <hi>Reward,</hi> that is <hi>only</hi> due to <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Law. In one Word, Reward and Puniſhment derive not only from <hi>different,</hi> but from <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Principles: And <hi>Impunity</hi> has, and that too in the Nature of the Thing, a Reſpect or Relation only to <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> but none at all to <hi>Reward:</hi> And for that Reaſon, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Impunity can have no Concern with <hi>Reward</hi> neither. Since then the Death of our Saviour is the meritorious Cauſe of <hi>Pardon</hi> to thoſe, who have <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed</hi> the Law; it is abſurd in Nature and Reaſon to make it alſo the meritorious Cauſe of that <hi>Reward,</hi> which, as it ſuppoſes no need of Pardon, ſo does by the Law only <hi>belong</hi> to thoſe, who have <hi>obeyed</hi> the Law. So that an <hi>Expiation</hi> does at the moſt but make a Man <hi>Innocent,</hi> but does nothing to make him a <hi>Saint:</hi> For it only <hi>cancels</hi> his Neglect of Duty, but does not <hi>do</hi> that Duty for him, which he has neglected.</p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:49679:100"/>
                     <p>By all which it appears,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Reward</hi> does in Propriety and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice only belong to <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>Puniſhment</hi> does in Propriety and Juſtice only belong to the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That <hi>Expiation</hi> has no Relation to the Reward of Obedience; but that it only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns that <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> which without ſuch Expiation is in Juſtice due to <hi>Diſobedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now becauſe God has taught us, not only that our Sins ſhall be <hi>forgiven</hi> in and through our Saviour; but that alſo, in and through the ſame Saviour, we ſhall obtain a glorious <hi>Reward:</hi> And becauſe (as has appeared in general) <hi>Reward</hi> does in Reaſon and Juſtice as properly belong to <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> as <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> does to <hi>Expiation:</hi> Therefore our next Enquiry muſt be, upon <hi>what</hi> Obedience ſuch Reward is grounded. For, we are very ſure, that, becauſe the Diſtribution of ſuch Reward is lodged in <hi>God's</hi> Hand, therefore the Reward will be beſtowed <hi>juſtly;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſure of <hi>that,</hi> therefore we are farther aſſured, that it will be conferr'd upon <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> And indeed, having in what went before ſeen what Proviſion God has made for the fulfilling the Vindictive Part of the Law, in order to the Poſſibility and Juſtice of Man's Salvation; and being ſatisfied, that <hi>that</hi> Proviſion, which he has made for <hi>that</hi> purpoſe, will <hi>not</hi> alſo fulfil the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49679:101"/>
                        <hi>Directive</hi> Part of the Law; it muſt be our next Buſineſs to enquire, what <hi>Proviſion</hi> he <hi>has</hi> made for the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of ſuch Directive Part. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, We may therefore be certain, that it ſhall be fulfilled one way or other; becauſe the Law being God's, is in it ſelf Holy, Juſt, and Good. And we know, (and that too by the Light of Nature) that it cannot be an indifferent Thing to the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and moſt Holy Law-giver, whether a Law, which is ſo, be obeyed, or not. For, that would be in effect to caſt off all Regard to Duty, Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs. Nay, (which is yet more) becauſe every juſt Law muſt for that Reaſon, even becauſe it is juſt, deſign the <hi>Obedience</hi> of them, for whom it is made; I ſay, becauſe it muſt <hi>principally</hi> and in the <hi>firſt</hi> place deſign their <hi>Obedience,</hi> and not their <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> (and therefore not their Forgiveneſs neither) it would be in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to contradict his own Deſign, in giving forth his Law. For, the Deſign of his Law being the Holineſs of his Creatures, reſulting from their Conformity to the Directions of ſuch Law; if he ſhould <hi>ſo</hi> pardon their Neglect of ſuch Conformity, (that is, the Neglect of their Obedience) as to make <hi>no</hi> Proviſion for ſuch Obedience; it is evident, that by ſo doing <hi>he</hi> would have no more Regard to the Directive Part of his own Law, than <hi>they</hi> have had; and ſo the <hi>Manner</hi> of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49679:101"/>Forgiving the Tranſgreſſion of the Law would unravel the main and principal <hi>Deſign</hi> of making the Law. But, we know very well, that ſuch a Way of Proceeding is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreeable to Wiſdom, nor to Holineſs; and therefore much leſs to Infinite Holineſs and Wiſdom. And therefore, if the Ever-Holy and Wiſe God <hi>gave</hi> up his beloved and only begotten Son to <hi>Death</hi> for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the <hi>vindictive</hi> Part of the Law; and if for the ſame purpoſe he puniſhes all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, not only with many <hi>Miſeries</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, but alſo with <hi>Death</hi> in their going <hi>out</hi> of it: I ſay, if he does all this, (which yet he himſelf tells us <hi>is his ſtrange Work</hi>) that ſo the <hi>vindictive</hi> Part of the Law may not fall to the Ground; ſhall we think, that he will do <hi>leſs,</hi> or indeed ſhall we think, that he will not rather do <hi>more,</hi> to make good the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>grand,</hi> and, I may add, the more natural Deſign of his Law, which is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his Creatures? No! we are ſure, that no Word of God ſhall return empty; and that therefore his more ſolemn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declarations (and ſuch are his Laws) ſhall be ſure to have their Accompliſhment, and ſhall be fulfilled in their due time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the counter-Endeavours of Hell and Wickedneſs. For, it ſhall not be in the Power of any Enemy to defeat the Counſels, or evacuate the main Deſign of that Law, which proceeds from Eternal and Eſſential
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49679:102"/>Holineſs, and which moreover is backed with Omnipotence. We may therefore very well be ſatisfied, that God has made Proviſion for the Performance and fulfilling of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Law, as well as of the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And we may be ſatisfied, in the ſecond place, that ſuch his Proviſion does and muſt extend it ſelf to <hi>Man,</hi> to <hi>whom</hi> the Law was given. For, it would be unreaſonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Deſign of any Law to be fulfilled, when ſuch Law is not obeyed by any of <hi>thoſe,</hi> for <hi>whom</hi> it was proclaimed, and to whom it was given. And therefore, becauſe the Law was given to <hi>Man,</hi> and requires Obedience from <hi>Man,</hi> we cannot ſay, that the Deſign of the Law is fulfilled, unleſs <hi>Men</hi> do obey it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We may be ſatisfied, in the third place, that <hi>no</hi> Man in this World (except our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour alone) <hi>has</hi> obeyed the <hi>Directions</hi> of the Law, from the Days of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, to this very Day. And we may be ſatisfied moreover, from ſo long an Experience of the Thing, and from Reaſon grounded upon ſuch Experience; but, if both will not do, we may be ſatisfied from Scripture, that no Man ever <hi>will</hi> or <hi>ſhall</hi> pay a perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuch Directions. Nay, it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that <hi>no</hi> Man does ſo, becauſe we know, that every Man in this World is under the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law; and we know, that every
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49679:102"/>Man <hi>is</hi> ſo, becauſe we are aſſured, that every Man in his going out of the World ſhall <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo</hi> ſuch Curſe, that is, that every Man ſhall <hi>die.</hi> Now, Death being the Penalty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſigned by the Law to the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law; we may be ſure, that thoſe, who are not only <hi>liable</hi> to ſuch Penalty, but who ſhall alſo certainly <hi>undergo</hi> it, are <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors</hi> of the Law. And then, becauſe that is the Caſe of <hi>all</hi> Men in this World, we may from hence alſo conclude, that <hi>all</hi> Men in this World are <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Part of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We may be ſatisfied, in the fourth place, (both becauſe it is the Object of each good <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Faith and Hope in particular, and becauſe it is an expreſs Revelation of the Will of God in general) that <hi>ſome</hi> Men ſhall be <hi>ſaved;</hi> that is, ſhall obtain an Eternal Happineſs in another World; tho' we know moſt aſſuredly, that <hi>all</hi> Men do <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> the Law in this World. Now, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in Juſtice, and abſurd in Reaſon, that Vengeance and Salvation ſhould <hi>both</hi> be the Recompence of the Tranſgreſſion of the Law; and becauſe, tho' all Men are Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe Tranſgreſſors ſhall be purſued with <hi>Vengeance,</hi> yet <hi>others,</hi> upon the Account of their ſincere, tho' im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Obedience, ſhall be rewarded with <hi>Salvation:</hi> Therefore we do infer in the</p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:49679:103"/>
                     <p n="5">5. Fifth place, That thoſe who ſhall be ſo rewarded, ſhall, in order to ſuch their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, be then entitled to a perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when ſuch Reward ſhall come to be beſtowed: That this is a Truth laid down in the Covenant of Grace, the Covenant by which alone Men ſhall obtain Salvation: That Reaſon and Juſtice do fall in with ſuch Covenant, in aſſerting and maintaining the ſame Truth; and that therefore it is every way firm and good. For, it ſounds harſh to our natural Senſe of Juſtice, that without a <hi>perfect</hi> Obedience a Man ſhould obtain that Reward, which in Juſtice and Reaſon can only be allotted to <hi>ſuch</hi> Obedience. For, an Obedience that falls <hi>ſhort</hi> of Perfection, is in truth and reality (whatever it is called) a <hi>Tranſgreſſion:</hi> And ſo is ſo far from <hi>deſerving</hi> a <hi>Reward,</hi> that it does indeed <hi>ſtand in need</hi> of a <hi>Pardon.</hi> For, the <hi>Defect</hi> of ſuch Obedience is <hi>Sin;</hi> and Sin mixed with <hi>any</hi> thing, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the <hi>whole,</hi> and makes it unclean and impure; and we know, that nothing that is ſo can enter into the Kingdom of God. And therefore, in order to his Salvation, St. <hi>Paul</hi> renounces <hi>his own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law,</hi> in the Third to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and the Ninth Verſe. Alas! the very beſt of us in this World have our Failings and Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and not only ſinful <hi>Weakneſſes,</hi> but ſinful <hi>Wilfulneſſes</hi> alſo: Nay, our very Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes are but filthy Rags: And then we
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49679:103"/>may be ſatisfied, that we ſhall never in thoſe Rags be admitted to the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb. When the Prodigal Son returned to his Father, the Father not only provided the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> but the <hi>Robe</hi> and the <hi>Ring</hi> too, to qualifie his Son to be a <hi>fit</hi> Gueſt for ſuch a Feaſt.</p>
                     <p>Now from theſe Propoſitions, ſo laid down and confirmed, it may ſeem no very remote Conſequence, that <hi>that</hi> Righteouſneſs, to which thoſe, who ſhall be ſaved, ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, in order to ſuch their Salvation, ſhall be the Righteouſneſs of <hi>that</hi> Perſon, whom the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſets forth to be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of Mankind. For, their Salvation muſt in Juſtice and Reaſon depend upon their <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to the Law; otherwiſe ſuch Salvation can in no Senſe be truly reckoned a <hi>Reward.</hi> And if that Obedience, to which ſuch Reward is by the Law aſſigned, were entirely their <hi>own,</hi> then that Perſon, whom yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures call their Saviour, could in no Senſe be truly ſo called, becauſe in ſuch Caſe their Salvation would be their <hi>own legal</hi> Purchaſe, as being the Reward of their <hi>own</hi> Obedience. And laſtly, to ſuppoſe the Saviour to be therefore their Saviour, becauſe he beſtows upon them Salvation, in Conſideration of an <hi>Imperfect</hi> Obedience, that is, an Obedience which is ſo <hi>far</hi> from deſerving Salvation, that it does indeed <hi>ſtand</hi> in need of a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> is to ſuppoſe him to beſtow the Reward
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49679:104"/>
                        <hi>there,</hi> where the Law does <hi>not</hi> lay it; that is, upon Suppoſition that ſuch Law is Juſt, it is to ſuppoſe him to be Unjuſt. From all which, the Concluſion at laſt muſt be, That ſince their Saviour muſt ſave them for their <hi>exact</hi> Obedience to the Law, (if he ſave them <hi>juſtly</hi>) and ſince we are ſure, that he does ſave them <hi>juſtly,</hi> tho' they have paid <hi>no</hi> ſuch Obedience; that therefore the Method in which he ſaves them, is by entitling them to a perfect Obedience. Now, how that is done, will be our Buſineſs to make out; as alſo, that the Manner of his doing it is juſt and righteous, and therefore reaſonable. By which it will appear, that our preſent Way of Reaſoning does not want its Weight, tho' perhaps it may at preſent ſeem too light to demand an Aſſent. But before we proceed to that, we ſhall offer a few Practical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon what has been already laid down.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, From what has been ſaid, we may eaſily perceive, that God is not ſo fond of our Perſons, or of our future and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs, as to provide for ſuch our Happineſs, by his own Neglect of his own Law. For, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away; but one Tittle of his Law ſhall not do ſo.</hi> Tho' therefore <hi>we</hi> can eaſily allow our ſelves to break his Law, and make light of his Commands; yet we may therefore be ſure, that <hi>he</hi> will not do ſo, becauſe his Commands
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49679:104"/>and his Laws are Holy. For, it is a fooliſh and vain Imagination to think, that eſſential Juſtice and Holineſs, that is, in other Words, that God will put Slights upon himſelf, to gratifie thoſe with Impunity, and much leſs with Glory and Immortality, who put Slights upon Holineſs, by ſinning againſt his Laws. The truth of it is, becauſe <hi>we</hi> are fond of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and very deſirous of our own Happineſs, we are (ay! and the very beſt of us too) too apt to think that <hi>God</hi> is ſo too; and in this Caſe we are fooliſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think him to be <hi>altogether ſuch an one as our ſelves:</hi> And this makes us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>eaſie</hi> Thoughts of his <hi>Mercy;</hi> and in the mean time to have no <hi>due</hi> Regard to his <hi>Juſtice.</hi> But, if we would but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that both his Mercy and his Juſtice are guided by his Holineſs; and that as he will not <hi>puniſh</hi> us without our <hi>Demerit,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he <hi>reward</hi> us unleſs we become <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</hi> I ſay, if we would but ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, it might be an effectual Means to engage us to look better to our Ways; leſt whilſt we think we are on our Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Happineſs, we be found by Miſtake to tread in the broad Road, that leads to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From what has been ſaid, we may learn where to ſeek and to find what we do all naturally deſire, and that is Happineſs. I ſay, we may learn, that it is only to be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49679:105"/>
                        <hi>ſought wiſely,</hi> and to be <hi>found certainly</hi> in the Ways of <hi>Holineſs.</hi> For, tho' our Sins may be expiated by the Death of our Saviour; yet when we have made our ſelves Sinners, we are not ſure that we ſhall be made <hi>Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> of ſuch Expiation, and ſo we are not ſure of the <hi>Pardon</hi> of ſuch our Sins; and we are ſure, that <hi>without</hi> returning to the Paths of Holineſs, we ſhall <hi>not</hi> be made Partakers of ſuch Expiation, and that therefore we ſhall only <hi>enjoy</hi> the <hi>Benefit</hi> of it, when we are <hi>found</hi> in ſuch <hi>Paths.</hi> The moſt certain Means therefore of <hi>making</hi> our ſelves <hi>happy,</hi> will be by <hi>keeping</hi> our ſelves <hi>holy:</hi> For, ſo long as we do ſo, we keep our ſelves within the reach of the Goſpel-Promiſes; and tho' our Holineſs be not in this World perfect, yet (as we ſhall ſee ſhortly) God will provide a way to make that and our Happineſs perfect in another World.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By what has been ſaid, we may learn, how it comes to paſs, that we have no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and entire <hi>Happineſs</hi> in this World; and that is, becauſe we have not here any ſincere and entire <hi>Holineſs.</hi> For, were we freed from all <hi>Sin,</hi> we ſhould be alſo freed from all <hi>Miſery.</hi> For, we miſtake, if we do not think, that Croſſes, Loſles, Pains, Sickneſs, and Death, are all of them the Effects of our Sins: And we may be ſure, that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſo, becauſe we are ſure, that when our Sins are done away, all theſe Miſeries
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49679:105"/>ſhall be taken away too. No! Sin is mixed with our Life; That ſpots, ſtains, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts it; and ſo Affliction and Miſery come to be mixed with it too. And therefore, were Sin once baniſhed out of this lower World, and true Righteouſneſs planted in its Place; were God's Will done in Earth, as it is done in Heaven; his Kingdom would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come, and the Glories and Beatitudes of Heaven would certainly flow in upon all thoſe, who have arrived to a perfect, that is, to an Heavenly Holineſs. Since therefore we may be ſo eaſily ſatisfied, that it is Sin, and Sin alone, that impairs our Happineſs, and that too (that Happineſs which moſt of us love ſo well) our Happineſs in this World; one would think, that this Conſideration ſingle, and by its ſelf, ſhould engage us to <hi>hate Sin,</hi> as much as we <hi>love</hi> ſuch our <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;</hi> and therefore alſo to endeavour to <hi>encreaſe</hi> our <hi>Happineſs,</hi> by <hi>deſtroying</hi> our <hi>Sins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. If our Good Works are ſo full of Flaws and Imperfections, that, in order to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it will be neceſſary, that we be entitled to a Perfect Obedience; then this may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, not to truſt in them <hi>alone</hi> for our Salvation. For, tho' it be true, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved <hi>without</hi> them; yet it is as true, that we cannot be ſaved by them <hi>alone;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an Imperfect Cauſe can never produce a Perfect Effect. Such Salvation then, as the Goſpel has taught us to hope and expect, <hi>God</hi>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:49679:106"/>in our Saviour only can <hi>beſtow;</hi> but <hi>we</hi> can never by our Good Works <hi>deſerve.</hi> And therefore, even he, who has wrought out ſuch Salvation for us, has taught us (when we have done the beſt we can) ſtill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſelves <hi>unprofitable Servants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Laſtly, If no Man's Obedience be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this World, then it will but ill become us to <hi>boaſt</hi> of our Perfection <hi>here:</hi> Which in this latter Age has been the known Practice of ſeveral proud Seducers, and Enthuſiaſts; who have therefore deſpiſed all other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> but thoſe of their own Caſt or Sect, as carnal and profane Creatures. A Pride hateful to God and Man, and ſuch, which has conſtantly betrayed it ſelf to come from that proud Spirit, (which is the great Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) by the detected Falſities, Forgeries, and Villanies of its moſt celebrated Pretenders. Let us therefore have a care, that we be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and humble: Let us not be <hi>high-minded, but fear:</hi> And ſeeing <hi>there remaineth a Reſt for the People of God,</hi> let us <hi>labour to enter into that Reſt, leſt any of us fall ſhort, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> not only of our <hi>Unbelief,</hi> but of our <hi>Confidence</hi> alſo.</p>

Some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections anſwered; and the Doctrine of the Imputation aſſerted,</hi> 1. <hi>Againſt thoſe, who acknowledge the Expiation;</hi> 2. <hi>Againſt thoſe, who deny it. This Doctrine agreeable to the Scriptures.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving laid it down in the former Chapter, that thoſe who ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with <hi>Eternal</hi> Happineſs, ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to a <hi>Perfect</hi> Obedience, in order to ſuch their Reward: Our next Buſineſs is to enquire, <hi>Whoſe</hi> that Perfect Obedience is, to which they ſhall be ſo entitled; and whether they can <hi>obtain</hi> ſuch Title according to the Rules of Reaſon, and the Laws of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And to ſatisfie this Enquiry, we lay it down, firſt, That as the <hi>Obedience</hi> of our Saviour to the Law, while he was in the Fleſh, (and ſo under the Law) does alone in Juſtice <hi>deſerve</hi> that Eternal Happineſs, which is promiſed in the Goſpel; ſo the <hi>Imputation</hi> of ſuch his Righteouſneſs to Believers, is the only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> Reaſon, why they ſhall be made Partakers of ſuch Eternal Happineſs. When the Apoſtle tells us, in the Fourth to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49679:107"/>the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the Fourth and Fifth Verſes, That <hi>God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law;</hi> he ſeems to inſinuate at leaſt, that our Saviour's being under the Law, was in ſuch Saviour a requiſite Condition in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his working out of Man's Salvation. Now, had our Saviour been <hi>ſuch</hi> a Man as <hi>other</hi> Men are, the Reward (it is confeſſed) had only concerned his <hi>own</hi> Obedience: But, becauſe by taking upon him the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man, he obliged himſelf to obey that Law, which God had given to <hi>Man;</hi> and becauſe he <hi>took</hi> upon himſelf the Nature of Man, when he might <hi>have refuſed</hi> ſo to do; and laſtly, becauſe he took it upon himſelf for <hi>Man's</hi> ſake alone, and not for his <hi>own;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for <hi>Man's</hi> ſake alone, and not for his <hi>own,</hi> he put himſelf under an Obligation of <hi>obeying</hi> the Law. From all which, the leaſt that can be inferred is, that Man was to reap <hi>ſome</hi> conſiderable <hi>Benefit</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> from ſuch <hi>his</hi> Obedience.</p>
                     <p>It is uſually alledged in this Place, That had he not obeyed the Law himſelf, he could not have been qualified to make an Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Death for the Tranſgreſſion of others: And we may take notice, that they who offer this Allegation, do in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tell us, that his perſect Obedience to the Law, was nothing more, in order to Man's Salvation, than a previous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49679:107"/>to ſit and capacitate him to make ſuch Expiation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And therefore we offer it to Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſecond place, That the Reward promiſed <hi>in a Saviour</hi> to thoſe, who do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly pay but an <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience to the Law, is <hi>greater</hi> than that Reward which was promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>perfect</hi> Obedience, <hi>without</hi> a Saviour. It is true, there is not in the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> any expreſs Promiſe at all: But then it is as true, that there is an implied Promiſe. For, when the Law does <hi>threaten</hi> his <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> with <hi>Death,</hi> it does as good as <hi>promiſe Life</hi> to his <hi>Obedience.</hi> And indeed, there was no <hi>Occaſion,</hi> much leſs any <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> that the Promiſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (which was Life) ſhould be expreſs; becauſe the Law being given to Man in his Innocence, (that is, while he was in <hi>actual Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Reward) he was by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Law ſecure of ſuch Poſſeſſion, if he did not forfeit it by his Tranſgreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Now we therefore ſay, that the Reward promiſed <hi>in a Saviour</hi> to thoſe, who do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly pay but an <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience to the Law, is <hi>greater</hi> than that Reward which was promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>perfect Innocence;</hi> becauſe we are aſſured by the Goſpel, that <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter into the Heart of Man to conceive, the Reward which God has prepared for thoſe,</hi> who in a <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhall be ſaved. But we are ſure,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49679:108"/>that no ſuch Things can be truly ſaid of the Reward promiſed to Man in his <hi>Innocence:</hi> For, he knew his Reward experimentally, and therefore it could not be to him Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable.</p>
                     <p>Put we the Queſtion then, How comes the Reward promiſed in the <hi>New</hi> Covenant, ſo far to differ from, and to exceed the Reward promiſed in the <hi>Old?</hi> For, no doubt, there is therefore a good Reaſon for ſuch Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, becauſe all God's Words and Actions proceed (if I may be allowed ſo to ſpeak) from Eſſential <hi>Reaſon:</hi> And it is as certain, that they all proceed from <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Now, neither Juſtice nor Reaſon do tell us, that an <hi>Immenſe</hi> and <hi>Inconceivable</hi> Reward can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to a <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience; and, in the mean while, a <hi>leſs</hi> Reward be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to a <hi>perfect</hi> Obedience. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a leſs Reward was propoſed to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Obedience, (had ſuch his Obedience been <hi>perfect</hi>) than what in a Saviour is propoſed to a <hi>Chriſtians imperfect</hi> Obedience; it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that ſuch different Rewards can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Juſtice nor Reaſon be aſſigned to the different Obediences, as <hi>ſuch;</hi> but that the Reward to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt derive from his <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Merits, as the Reward of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have derived from his <hi>own.</hi> If therefore it be demanded, upon what Grounds the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Reward does derive from his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; the only Anſwer that can be given,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49679:108"/>is, That it muſt derive either from his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's <hi>Sufferings</hi> in his ſtead, or from his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Obedience</hi> in his ſtead. And then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have already made it out, that it cannot either in Juſtice or Reaſon, or indeed in Common Senſe, derive from his Saviour's <hi>Sufferings</hi> (which do and can, and that too in Nature, only relate to his <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> but not at all to his <hi>Reward</hi>) therefore we do at laſt conclude, that that immenſe Reward which the Goſpel aſſigns to the believing <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> it does aſſign to him only in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his Saviour's <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before we go any farther, we may from what has been ſaid, obſerve, That the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Value of our Saviour's <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> does ſhew forth it ſelf, as well in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Value of his <hi>Obedience,</hi> as in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Value of his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sufferings.</hi> For, as it is evident, that the Reward of <hi>his</hi> Obedience is inconceivably <hi>greater</hi> than the Reward of <hi>Adam</hi>'s had been, (had <hi>Adam</hi> been obedient) ſo, for the ſame Reaſon, it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater than the Obedience of any <hi>other</hi> Man, were that other only <hi>ſuch</hi> a Man as <hi>Adam</hi> was. The <hi>Dignity</hi> therefore of the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> is inconceivably greater, than the Dignity of the <hi>firſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, as by what has been ſaid, it has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that the Obedience of our Saviour is the only Obedience, that is or can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to a Goſpel-Reward; ſo, in what is to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49679:109"/>follow, we muſt make it our Buſineſs to ſhew, firſt, that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Believers <hi>may</hi> in Reaſon and Juſtice be <hi>entitled</hi> to ſuch his Obedience, (which is to be made good by <hi>Reaſon;</hi>) and, in the next place, that they ſhall <hi>actually be</hi> ſo, (which is to be made good by <hi>Scripture.</hi>) And then, if upon the whole Matter it ſhall appear, that they <hi>may</hi> be ſo entitled, and that in order to their Salvation, it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> that they <hi>be</hi> ſo; then the Concluſion will be, That the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Imputation is therefore <hi>true,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Salvation</hi> of Believers is <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> But then I would have it remarked, that I only ſay, that this Concluſion will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if our Reaſons prove good. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Believers</hi> is generally agreed to be <hi>expreſs</hi> Revelation; but the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> in order to ſuch Salvation, is <hi>not;</hi> therefore, as our Reaſons, and thoſe Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Scriptures which we bring to back them, may be found defective; ſo, when once they appear ſo to be, I do profeſs in this Caſe, as in all others, that I ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly part with them; becauſe to me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and on all Sides acknowledged Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, do weigh a great deal more, than all Reaſonings, and elaborate Deductions, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Now, to make it out, That our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Obedience may be juſtly and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably imputed, or aſſigned over to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in order to their obtaining the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49679:109"/>of ſuch Obedience, I would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt place, That it is a Thing in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner generally agreed among Mankind, that <hi>one</hi> Man's Duty (in many Caſes at leaſt) may be done by <hi>another,</hi> and yet the <hi>Reward</hi> of ſuch Duty ſhall be thought, and that too juſtly, to belong, not ſo much to <hi>him</hi> who <hi>did</hi> the Duty, as to <hi>him for</hi> whom it was <hi>done.</hi> The Thing is notorious in all Proxies, Deputations, and Subſtitutions whatſoever: And every Proctor, Attorney, Sollicitor, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, Journey-man, Apprentice, and Servant, is a Witneſs and Proof of it. For, all ſuch Perſons do, as ſuch, act, not for <hi>themſelves,</hi> but for <hi>others;</hi> and the Benefits and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which ariſe from ſuch their Actions, do accrue to <hi>others;</hi> and, which is more, and more to our purpoſe, are by the Common Senſe of Mankind thought to do ſo <hi>juſtly.</hi> And tho' it be confeſſed, that in <hi>moſt,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> the Caſes mentioned, ſome Benefit does come to <hi>him,</hi> who actually <hi>does</hi> the Duty; yet it is known alſo, that ſuch Benefit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his Due, only by a <hi>collateral</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; but that it is neither the <hi>full,</hi> nor the <hi>direct</hi> Reward of the Duty done by him. For, the whole Right of ſuch Reward is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally thought to belong to his Principal. And I do hardly believe, that any Man, tho' never ſo juſt and righteous, does then think that he wrongs his Journey-man, when he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49679:110"/>pays him his Wages agreed between them, tho' by ſo doing he does not allow him all that Profit, which he himſelf reaps by his Work. But if any Man, the better to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Argument, ſhall reſolve with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to go againſt the ordinary Senſe of Mankind in the Caſe, and ſhall pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affirm, that ſuch Dealing is unjuſt (as I am ſatisfied, that in ſome ſpecial Caſes ſome Men are ſo reſolved) I ſhall not at preſent (becauſe I need not) contend the Point with them; but ſhall add in the</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Second place, that which ſerves as well for our preſent Deſign, but what is more free from all Exception; and that is, That if any <hi>Friend,</hi> purely of his Good-will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Expectation of Recompence or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nay, with a fixed Reſolution not to receive any; I ſay, if ſuch a Friend ſhall undertake and diſcharge the Duty of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> whether his ſo doing may not ſo far be imputed to ſuch other, as to entitle him to that Reward, which belongs to ſuch Duty. To ſay, <hi>[It cannot]</hi> would go a great way towards the making of all Friendſhip uſeleſs, and would have a great tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rendring of all Peoples Lives for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn and comfortleſs; and, when throughly examined, would be found to contain ſo much Uncharitableneſs in it, that (were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the Caſe) yet ſuch an Opinion, purely upon the account of its Malignity,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49679:110"/>and ill-natur'd Influence upon Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, may very well be thought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Juſtice in it, to which it pretends. And therefore, becauſe a mutual and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> of each other, in the Diſcharge of the ſeveral Duties that lie upon us; and ſometimes in the <hi>undertaking</hi> and <hi>performing</hi> each others Duties <hi>entirely,</hi> is very beneficial to Mankind in general; and becauſe <hi>Juſtice</hi> is ſo too; therefore we ſhall rather conclude, that it is <hi>agreeable</hi> to Juſtice, than that it <hi>contradicts</hi> it, that <hi>one</hi> Man may, not only <hi>receive,</hi> but alſo have a <hi>Right</hi> to the Reward of that Duty, which yet is <hi>done</hi> for him by <hi>another.</hi> To which we ſhall add,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the third place, That when <hi>one</hi> Man is <hi>diſabled</hi> from doing his Duty, and <hi>another,</hi> in Compaſſion to his Diſability, <hi>does</hi> it <hi>for</hi> him; there it will be ſo far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that the diſabled Perſon ſhould receive the Reward of the Duty ſo done, that it would be uncharitable (and all Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is at leaſt a Degree of Injuſtice) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar him of ſuch Reward.</p>
                     <p>Now before we proceed any further, we do, in order to our main Deſign, from the Propoſitions already laid down and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conclude in the firſt place, That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour being <hi>made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> that is, being Incarnate, and made Man, in order to qualifie himſelf, among other Things, to fulfil the Directions of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49679:111"/>Law given to Man, might juſtly (if he ſo deſigned and pleaſed) do that Duty for other Men, which the Law laid upon them as their Duty; and by doing ſuch Duty in their ſtead, might <hi>entitle</hi> them to that <hi>Reward,</hi> which the Law had promiſed to thoſe, who ſhould obey it. For, the <hi>Reward,</hi> by the Tenor of the Law, becoming his <hi>Right,</hi> upon the Account of his Obedience, there can (I think) no doubt be made, but that he may, and that juſtly too, <hi>Aſſign</hi> over ſuch his Right to whom he pleaſes; and that he may ſo much the rather do ſo, becauſe thoſe, to whom he makes ſuch Aſſignment, were utterly <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,</hi> and that too without their own Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fault, to do ſuch Duty themſelves. And there can be the leſs doubt, that he might ſo do, becauſe, had it not been for Man's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, and for Man's ſake, there had been no Occaſion, and much leſs any Neceſſity, that he ſhould have been Incarnate, and ſo have been made Man himſelf; that is, (ſo far as we are concerned at preſent) there had been neither Occaſion nor Neceſſity that he ſhould have brought himſelf under any <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of <hi>obeying</hi> the Law given to <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, if we add, to what has been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that our Saviour will <hi>only</hi> aſſign over the Reward of his Obedience to <hi>thoſe,</hi> who tho' they neither <hi>did</hi> nor <hi>could</hi> obey the Law, yet however were <hi>willing,</hi> and did teſtifie the Sincerity of their Willingneſs by their hearty
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49679:111"/>
                        <hi>Endeavours</hi> to have obeyed it; and who moreover were heartily <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>troubled,</hi> that they could <hi>not</hi> make good their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, (which yet is really the Caſe between our Saviour, and all thoſe, who ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for his Righteouſneſs:) I ſay, if we add <hi>this</hi> Conſideration to all the <hi>former,</hi> it may perhaps help to give us a more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Satisfaction in the Caſe, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that his Aſſignment of the Reward of his own Obedience, to ſuch People, is an Act of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as well as <hi>Pity;</hi> becauſe God, by <hi>putting</hi> his Creatures into <hi>Being,</hi> has (and with all Reverence I deſire to ſpeak it) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated them in a <hi>Right</hi> to ſuch Things, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> which they muſt needs be <hi>miſerable,</hi> and which (tho' they heartily endeavour it) yet they cannot by their <hi>own</hi> utmoſt Powers <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> themſelves with.</p>
                     <p>From the Whole, we may reſt ſatisfied, that the making over of that Happineſs, which was the Reward of our Saviour's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to other Men, is no ſuch abſurd or unjuſt Thing, as it is but too generally taken to be. And I am pretty well aſſured, that ſome even of thoſe Men, who have ſtiffly <hi>oppoſed</hi> it in the Caſe of Man's <hi>Salvation</hi> by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> yet both <hi>have</hi> and <hi>will allow</hi> it in <hi>other</hi> Caſes, that run <hi>parallel</hi> with it; and that therefore, in order to their taxing ſuch a Way of Proceeding of Injuſtice, they do even contradict themſelves.</p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49679:112"/>
                     <p>It may perhaps be objected, That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, by <hi>aſſigning</hi> the Reward of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any <hi>others,</hi> does by ſo doing <hi>diſpoſſeſs himſelf</hi> of ſuch Reward; becauſe, by making it <hi>over</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> he does in effect make it <hi>away</hi> from <hi>himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which ſeeming Difficulty (for ſo I ſhall only call it in this Place) may be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, if we do reflect back upon what has been ſaid in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> concerning the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Value</hi> of the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> made by our Saviour's Obedience, and the <hi>Inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Dignity</hi> of his <hi>Perſon:</hi> And, when we have made ſuch Reflection, ſhall go on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to compare it with what has been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, and made good, concerning the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive</hi> Merit of his Expiation, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sixth, and upon the Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Seventh Chapters. For, by comparing what has been ſaid in thoſe two Places, with the Caſe now before us, and by applying the one to the other, it will be no hard matter ſo to reſolve this ſeeming Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as that it ſhall not any longer appear to be any ſuch Thing.</p>
                     <p>But to return: As it has appeared, that Men may obtain the <hi>Reward</hi> promiſed by the Law, in <hi>virtue</hi> of their <hi>Saviour's</hi> Obedience to the Law, whereas yet they have not <hi>obeyed</hi> the Law <hi>themſelves;</hi> ſo, if the Reward due to their Saviour's Obedience, can <hi>therefore</hi> only be juſtly transferred upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49679:112"/>their Saviour did <hi>obey</hi> the Law in <hi>their</hi> ſtead: Then the next Concluſion will be,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>his</hi> Obedience to the Law muſt, in order to their receiving ſuch Reward, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as <hi>theirs;</hi> that is, in other Words, his Obedience to the Law muſt be firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them as theirs, before they can have a juſt Title to that Happineſs, which is only the legal and juſt Reward of his Obedience. For, if one Man performs that, which it was another Man's Duty to do, but yet <hi>does</hi> not do it, or, which is more, <hi>profeſſes</hi> that he does not do it <hi>for</hi> that other; in ſuch Caſe, that other can never in Juſtice either claim or receive the Reward belonging to ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; becauſe that Performance can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be made <hi>his,</hi> till it be made <hi>over</hi> by him, who was the <hi>Author</hi> of it. And, on the other ſide, it is no eaſie Matter to conceive, how one Man ſhould <hi>make over</hi> the <hi>Reward due</hi> by Law to his <hi>own</hi> Obedience, to <hi>another;</hi> if ſuch his <hi>Obedience,</hi> to which alone ſuch Reward is by the Law inſeparably annexed, be not ſome way or other made over alſo; And if ſuch Obedience, in ſuch a Caſe, muſt ſome way or other be made over; the leaſt that can be ſuppoſed, will be, that it muſt be made over by <hi>Imputation.</hi> For, the <hi>Merit</hi> of the Reward conſiſting in the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or Holineſs (which you will) of the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and the juſt <hi>Gift</hi> of the Reward (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law) depending upon the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49679:113"/>
                        <hi>Merit</hi> of that Reward; it is obvious to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that the <hi>Reward</hi> can only there be juſtly <hi>given,</hi> where the <hi>Merit</hi> is <hi>lodged;</hi> and that the <hi>Merit</hi> is only lodged <hi>there,</hi> where the <hi>Holineſs</hi> or <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the Obedience is lodged: For, the Promiſe of the Reward is only made to the Obedience. If therefore <hi>Eternal Happineſs</hi> (the Reward of Obedience to the Law) may be juſtly transferr'd to any Man, in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Saviour's Obedience; it will follow, that the <hi>Merit</hi> of ſuch Reward muſt (at leaſt Imputatively) be transferr'd alſo: And if the <hi>Merit</hi> of the Reward be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, then <hi>that,</hi> in which that Merit does alone conſiſt (and that is the Obedience) muſt be transferred likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>And, upon the whole Matter, we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that that <hi>Part</hi> of the Goſpel-Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which conſiſts in Eternal Happineſs, (which is the Reward of the Saviour's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience alone, in rigour of Law) may by that Saviour be juſtly <hi>aſſigned</hi> over to Man, which was the <hi>Firſt</hi> Thing which we undertook to make good: And, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That to make good the Juſtice of ſuch Aſſignment, that <hi>Obedience,</hi> to which alone ſuch Reward does in Law belong, muſt (at leaſt imputatively) be <hi>aſſigned</hi> over alſo.</p>
                     <p>It may be objected here, That I talk of the <hi>Law,</hi> when I ſhould talk of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> For, tho' it be true, that the Reward promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Law</hi> to Obedience does only <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:49679:113"/>and therefore can in Juſtice be only <hi>beſtowed</hi> upon a perfect Obedience; yet it is not true, that the Reward promiſed by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is ſo clogged or limited, but that by the Tenor of ſuch Goſpel it may belong to an Obedience that is not <hi>perfect,</hi> provided ſuch Obedience be attended with Sincerity, and followed with Repentance.</p>
                     <p>Now, in anſwer to this Objection, it is freely granted,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Promiſe of the Reward in the Goſpel-Covenant is, as it is ſaid to be; that is, it ſtands engaged to Sincerity and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and that therefore thoſe Believers that are <hi>ſincere</hi> in their <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> for their <hi>Failings,</hi> (tho' neither their Obedience, nor their Repentance be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect) yet ſhall inherit ſuch Promiſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But then, in the ſecond place, it muſt be alſo acknowledged, that God has made and eſtabliſhed that Promiſe of the New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and in our Saviour <hi>alone.</hi> Now, the Buſineſs of our preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is not, what <hi>is</hi> the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, (for in that we are agreed;) but upon what <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>rational Conſideration</hi> ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is <hi>founded.</hi> And ſince it is agreed in general, that it is founded in our Saviour; all the Debate at preſent is, Whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpel-Reward be founded in that Saviour's <hi>Obedience,</hi> or in his <hi>Death;</hi> or, in other Words, Whether the Promiſe of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49679:114"/>
                        <hi>Reward</hi> be not ſo grounded upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's <hi>Obedience,</hi> as the Promiſe of <hi>Pardon</hi> is upon his Expiatory <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And if thoſe Reaſons which we have already, or ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after offer, do prove, that in Juſtice and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is ſo; then the Objection vaniſhes.</p>
                     <p>I may add, That the Objection only ſpeaks to the Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> that there <hi>is</hi> a Promiſe made in the Goſpel to an Imperfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which no one, ſo far as I know, denies;) But it does not ſpeak, as to the Matter of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Juſtice, how</hi> ſuch a Promiſe can be <hi>juſtly</hi> and <hi>reaſonably</hi> made, without any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to the Law of <hi>Works, which</hi> is God's Law, as well as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is ſo: And we may be ſure, that God's Laws do not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contradict each other, or controul any the Laws or Rules of true Juſtice or Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>That then, which is the only Thing which is at preſent maintained, is, That the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the Reward in the Goſpel to an Imperfect Obedience had never been <hi>made</hi> to Man at all, becauſe it could not have been made juſtly, if the <hi>Law</hi> of Works given to Man had never been <hi>fulfilled</hi> by Man; and that the Goſpel-Promiſe was granted in Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that our Saviour fulfilled that Law. And to this, the Objection, ſo called, is really no Objection at all.</p>
                     <p>It is confeſſed indeed, that the Eternal Life promiſed to Believers in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> will be attended with an Happineſs inconceivably
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49679:114"/>
                        <hi>greater,</hi> than the Eternal Life promiſed in the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Adam;</hi> and it may be thereupon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that the Reward promiſed in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> has no Eye to the Obedience required in the <hi>Law;</hi> and (if it has not) that then the Eternal Happineſs of Believers cannot be the Purchaſe of our Saviour's Obedience to the Law.</p>
                     <p>To which I ſhall ſay no more at preſent, than this; <hi>viz.</hi> That it is agreed, that our Saviour by his Death took away Death, the Curſe of the Law, and made good ſuch his Atchievement by a Reſurrection. Now, the Life after the Reſurrection is a Life in a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Body, not in a <hi>Natural,</hi> (I ſpeak the Apoſtle's Words:) And our Natural Reaſon tells us, that a Life in a Spiritual Body, is a more refined and exalted Life, than a Life in a Natural Body; and that in multitudes of Circumſtances it muſt needs differ from it; perhaps in ſo many, that it may be as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable to us now, as the future Happineſs of the Saints. And yet this refined and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Life is no good Argument, that it was not purchaſed by our Saviour's <hi>Death;</hi> nor, that ſuch his Death had no Eye to the Law of <hi>Works</hi> in ſuch Purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>And ſo ſay we: Tho' the Happineſs of the Bleſſed be <hi>greater,</hi> vaſtly greater, than what was by the Law of Works promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his Obedience; yet that can never make it out, that ſuch Happineſs is not the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49679:115"/>Purchaſe of our Saviour's Obedience, or that ſuch his Obedience was not an Obedience to the Law of <hi>Works.</hi> It may indeed convince us of the ſuper-eminent Dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of the inconceivable Value of that Reward, which by being purchaſed by him, derives ſuch its Value from ſuch his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as we obſerved before; and which is directly to our preſent purpoſe, it may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore convince us, that the Reward of Believers is the Reward of their <hi>Saviour's</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience made over to them; but not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that does or can belong to their own (at the very beſt) <hi>Imperfect</hi> Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>I know very well, that this Doctrine is denied by many Divines, and other Learned Men; and thoſe too, not only ſuch, who do utterly <hi>deny,</hi> that God beſtows Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men in conſideration of their Saviour's Merit and Purchaſe; but even by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of thoſe, who yet do <hi>aſcribe</hi> the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Man to ſuch Purchaſe and Merits. What Reaſons they offer for ſuch their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, we ſhall ſpeak to hereafter: But, in the mean time, we ſhall go on to make good the Imputation, againſt each Party that denies it; and after that, ſhall ſhew, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch their Denial have not that weight which they ſeem to have.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, we ſhall ſpeak to them, who do not barely <hi>acknowledge,</hi> but even <hi>contend,</hi> that the Salvation of Man is obtained in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49679:115"/>Conſideration of the Merits, that is, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Death of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>And the Men of whom we now ſpeak, do maintain, That in order to Man's Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our Saviour died for Man's Sin; and that, by ſuch his Death, he puchaſed for Man a Freedom from that Vengeance, which is the juſt Wages of ſuch Sin. Now, what they ſo maintain, we believe to be true, and are ready to join Hands with them to make it good, againſt all the Adverſaries of the Croſs of Chriſt. So far therefore we are agreed. But then, it may be demanded, How our Saviour can poſſibly ſuffer for <hi>Man's</hi> Sin, if the Sin of Man be not <hi>imputed</hi> to him? For, in order to his ſuffering for Man's Sin, he muſt take upon him ſuch Sin; and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him Man's Sin, is the having Man's Sin accounted as his own; that is, in effect, and in other Words, the having Man's Sin imputed to him. And then, on the other Side, how can Man have any Pretence of <hi>Benefit</hi> from his Saviour's Sufferings, if the Merit of ſuch Sufferings be not <hi>imputed</hi> to Man? For, without ſuch Imputation, the Merit (be it what it will) can only belong to the Saviour himſelf.</p>
                     <p>It is evident therefore, by what has been ſaid in ſhort, but might be made out in more Words) that they who aſſert the Expiation of Sin by our Saviour's ſuffering in Man's ſtead, do therefore entitle Man to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49679:116"/>of ſuch Expiation, becauſe Man's <hi>Sin</hi> was <hi>imputed</hi> to his Saviour, and the <hi>Merit</hi> of his Saviour's Sufferings, at leaſt, <hi>imputed</hi> to Man.</p>
                     <p>Things therefore ſtanding thus in the Caſe of the Expiation, it may be reaſonably and further demanded, Why our Saviour's <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi> may not as warrantably be imputed to <hi>Man,</hi> as Man's <hi>Sin</hi> may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his <hi>Saviour?</hi> or, Why the <hi>Eternal Happineſs,</hi> which is aſſigned as the Reward of Obedience by the Law, may not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon Man in Conſideration, that the Merit of his Saviour's <hi>Obedience</hi> is imputed to Man; as well as a <hi>Releaſe</hi> from Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be granted to Man in Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Merits of his <hi>Saviour's</hi> Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are imputed to Man? For, there is the very ſelf-ſame Reaſon, why the <hi>Obedience</hi> of our Saviour ſhould be imputed to Man, in order to Man's <hi>Salvation,</hi> that there is, that the <hi>Sin</hi> of Man ſhould be imputed to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in order to ſuch Saviour's <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And there is the ſelf-ſame Reaſon, why the Merit of our Saviour's <hi>Obedience</hi> ſhould be imputed to Man, in order to Man's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Eternal</hi> Life; as there is, that the Merits of our Saviour's <hi>Sufferings</hi> ſhould be imputed to Man, in order to Man's <hi>Releaſe</hi> from Death. That is, Imputation is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and as juſtifiable in <hi>one Caſe,</hi> as in the <hi>other;</hi> for they both ſtand upon one and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49679:116"/>the ſame Foot; and for that Reaſon, he who throws down one, throws down both. And therefore, whoever rejects the Doctrine of the Imputation of our Saviour's <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to Man, does, by ſo doing, reject the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Man's <hi>Sin</hi> to our Saviour, and all the Conſequences of it: Or, in other Words, he who rejects the Doctrine of the <hi>Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> does, by ſo doing, reject the Doctrine of the <hi>Expiation</hi> likewiſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe Men who do ſo far maintain Man's Salvation to depend upon the Merits of our Saviour's Death alone, as to deny Imputed Righteouſneſs to have any thing to do in the Purchaſe of Salvation, do not ſeem to me ſufficiently to conſider, that there are Two Things contained in the Death of our Saviour; 1. The <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf; and, 2. His <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Will of his Father, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf to ſuch a Death. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Death is, properly ſpeaking, what he underwent for the Expiation of Man's Sin, (for the Vindictive Part of the Law does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſign Death as the Puniſhment of Sin) hence it is (as I conceive) that moſt of thoſe who have diſcourſed of Man's Redemption for the Sake and Merit of our Saviour's Death, have placed the Merit of the Purchaſe only in ſuch <hi>Death;</hi> and in the mean time have wholly laid aſide all Conſideration of the Merit of that <hi>Obedience,</hi> which attended it. But becauſe the Scriptures in the Caſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49679:117"/>ſpeak otherwiſe, and becauſe we muſt needs be beſt inſtructed out of them, in any thing which concerns our Saviour; therefore, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide at preſent all Schemes of Humane Reaſoning or Contrivance, we ſhall entirely apply our ſelves to them for ſuch Inſtruction. Take we notice therefore, that they inform us, that our Saviour was <hi>delivered to death by the determinate Counſel and Foreknowledge of God:</hi> So St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, in the Second of <hi>Acts,</hi> and Twenty third Verſe; and ſo we are told in other Places. From which we infer, that the <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of our Saviour was an Act of <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Will and Counſel of God. All which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us in a few Words, but thoſe very full to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Purpoſe, when he tells us, in the Second to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the Eighth Verſe, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt being found in faſhion as a Man, humbled himſelf, and became</hi> obedient <hi>unto</hi> Death, <hi>even the Death of the Croſs.</hi> Since therefore our Saviour's Death was, at leaſt, one Branch of his <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Will of his Father; that is, ſince his <hi>Obedience</hi> in the Scripture-Account was ſhewed in his <hi>Death,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Life;</hi> and therefore Both, when in Conjunction, were one and the <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame</hi> thing: I would deſire to know, upon what Ground, or by what Warrant, it can be <hi>imagined,</hi> and much leſs <hi>defended,</hi> that Man is ſaved for the ſake of his <hi>Death,</hi> but that he is not ſaved for the ſake of his <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:49679:117"/>And I would ſo much the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon this Inquiry, becauſe tho' it ſhould be granted, that our Saviour's Death was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of Man's Everlaſting Happineſs, (and that is the preſent Caſe) then, if we muſt make an Oppoſition between his Death and his Obedience, (and to aſcribe Man's Happineſs to his <hi>Death,</hi> but not to his <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> does make ſuch an Oppoſition;) but, I ſay, if there muſt be an Oppoſition made between them, it ſeems much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reaſon, nay indeed to common Senſe, to aſcribe ſuch Merit to the <hi>Obedience</hi> of his Death, than to his <hi>Death.</hi> For, it is the Voice of Natural Juſtice, that <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> may deſerve a <hi>Reward;</hi> but it is a Strain beyond Conceit, that <hi>Puniſhment</hi> ſhould do ſo too: For, if that were allowed, then the <hi>ſuffering</hi> of Puniſhment for the <hi>Breach</hi> of the Law, might be juſtly meritorious of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as well as <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Command</hi> of the Law; and ſo at long run it would come to the ſame Event to break the Law, as to keep it. But, becauſe that cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, therefore, if People will have an Oppoſition in the Caſe, where the Scripture has made none, we ſhould rather aſcribe Man's Eternal Happineſs to the <hi>Obedience</hi> of our Saviour's Death, than to the <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf. And then, if our Eternal Happineſs may be aſcribed to the Merit of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Obedience in <hi>one</hi> Caſe, why may it not
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49679:118"/>be ſo in <hi>more?</hi> For, for the ſame Reaſon that a Believer may be intereſſed in the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his <hi>Death,</hi> he may be intereſſed in the Obedience of his <hi>Life</hi> too. Since then, in the preſent Caſe, it is allowed, that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever has his Intereſt by Imputation in the <hi>firſt</hi> Caſe; it will follow, that he <hi>may,</hi> and (conſidering what has already been ſaid) that he <hi>muſt</hi> have it ſo in the <hi>laſt.</hi> That is, in a few Words, That the Obedience of our Saviour both in his <hi>Life,</hi> and in his <hi>Death,</hi> muſt purchaſe for Man that Happineſs, which by the Tenor of Juſtice is the proper and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated Reward of <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It being evident then, that for the ſame Reaſon, for which the Merits of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's <hi>Death</hi> may belong to Believers, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his <hi>Obedience</hi> may do ſo too; and that both the one and the other do therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, becauſe they are <hi>imputed</hi> to them: Our next Buſineſs muſt be with thoſe Men, who <hi>deny</hi> all Imputation whatſoever, and therefore neither allow the Merits of his Life or Death to have any thing to do in the Purchaſe of Man's Salvation.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe we have already and largely diſcourſed of the Purchaſe made by his <hi>Death:</hi> Our only Buſineſs at preſent will be to enquire concerning the Purchaſe made by his <hi>Obedience.</hi> And becauſe the Men, we have now to do with, do deny all Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what our Saviour did or ſuffered
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49679:118"/>whatſoever; therefore we ſhall lay down, and attempt the Proof of this following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: <hi>That that Righteouſneſs, by which Believers ſhall be judged, and in conſideration of which they ſhall obtain Salvation at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the Great Day, ſhall be the Obedience of their</hi> Saviour, <hi>while he lived in the Fleſh,</hi> imputed <hi>to ſuch Believers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In order to this, we take notice; in the firſt place, That the Scriptures do tell us, That all Men ſhall be judged according to their Works, that is, according to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or Diſobedience in this Life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We lay it down, in the ſecond place, That all thoſe who ſhall be adjudged to enjoy an Eternal Happineſs, muſt, in order to that bleſſed Sentence, be firſt entitled to a perfect Righteouſneſs. This, we reckon, is proved before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We take notice, in the third place, That no Man, tho' never ſo righteous, yet ever <hi>did, does,</hi> or <hi>ſhall</hi> arrive at a perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this Life.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion then, that remains to be reſolved, is, <hi>How</hi> any Man ſhall come to be entitled to a perfect Righteouſneſs, that ſo he may be entitled to Eternal Happineſs? And becauſe no Man can warrantably ſay, how he ſhall <hi>not</hi> be, unleſs he do aſſign ſome Way how he <hi>ſhall</hi> be ſo entitled; therefore they who in this Caſe deny all Imputation whatſoever, do tell us, that a perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49679:119"/>ſhall be beſtowed by God upon Believers by <hi>Infuſion;</hi> that is, (for ſo they muſt mean) God ſhall by his Mercy and Free-Grace beſtow ſuch a Stock of Holineſs upon Believers, as ſhall cleanſe and fill all their Capacities, and ſo make them perfectly holy, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence capable of Eternal Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Now tho' it be freely, granted, that God will in the next World beſtow ſuch an holy, God-like, and eternally-durable Frame of Spirit, upon all thoſe who ſhall be ſaved, (as we ſhall diſcourſe more fully hereafter) yet it is not in Conſideration of <hi>ſuch</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that Believers do obtain that Eternal Happineſs, which is the <hi>promiſed</hi> Reward of the Goſpel. For, by what is to follow, it will, we preſume, appear, that Salvation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Conſideration of our Saviour's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>imputed,</hi> is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Better accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Rules of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the Laws of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> than Salvation obtained in Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an Holineſs <hi>infuſed</hi> after a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That as it is better accommodated to the Rules of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and to the Laws of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> ſo, that it is ſo alſo to that Account which the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives us of this Matter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For, the Obedience by which Believers are to be judged at the laſt Day, is that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which was required of them in <hi>this</hi> World: And accordingly as Men have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelf <hi>here,</hi> ſo they ſhall receive the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49679:119"/>Reward of ſuch their Behaviour <hi>there.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Second to the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>We ſhall all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the Things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> By which we may underſtand, that the Diſtributions to be made by Juſtice upon a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> have an Eye to the Lives of Men <hi>before</hi> their Death: And from thence we may infer, that they are not to be guided by an infuſed Holineſs, which does (even by thoſe who plead for it) not take place, till <hi>after</hi> the Reſurrection. (For, it is agreed on all Hands, that no Man's Holineſs is perfect in this Life.) Now, it does not look alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo rational, nor ſo agreeable to the Meaſures of Juſtice, or the Revelations of Scripture, that a Man ſhould be <hi>judged</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he has done in the Body <hi>before</hi> his <hi>Death;</hi> and yet, that he ſhall by the laſt Judicial Sentence be everlaſtingly <hi>rewarded</hi> for an Holineſs infuſed by God <hi>after</hi> his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> And therefore, if we will adhere to Reaſon, Juſtice, and Revelation, we muſt conclude, that Believers do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Life obtain an everlaſting Happineſs in conſideration of ſuch an infuſed Holineſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And, ſecondly, we may do well to take notice, that the Obedience of our Saviour to the Law, was the Obedience which was required of Man, and which was alſo paid
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49679:120"/>by Man in <hi>this</hi> Life; and that becauſe ſuch his Obedience was perfect, therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſigned by the Law to Obedience, was in ſtrictneſs of Law and Juſtice due to <hi>ſuch</hi> his Obedience. If therefore his Obedience, while he was in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> may by any Means be ſo made over to Believers, as to be juſtly accounted theirs; then there can be no doubt, but that their Right to the Reward appointed to ſuch Obedience will be juſt and good too. And that it may be juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted theirs, we have, as we believe, made it good already. But an Holineſs <hi>infuſed</hi> by God <hi>after</hi> a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> can in no Senſe, nor in any Congruity be <hi>accounted,</hi> and much leſs can it <hi>be,</hi> an Obedience paid by Man (while in the <hi>Body</hi>) to the Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot in any Senſe, or in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, be ſuch an Holineſs, to which the Reward, allotted only to Obedience, can belong. And therefore, neither can Eternal Happineſs be beſtowed upon Believers, in conſideration of ſuch an infuſed Holineſs. In one Word, Infuſed Holineſs in order to Man's Salvation, does in no wiſe agree to that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the Scriptures give us of the Laſt Judgment; and tho' it pretends to <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie</hi> God's <hi>Mercy,</hi> yet it takes no care in the mean while to <hi>aſſert</hi> and <hi>vindicate</hi> his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> but makes the whole Proceſs of that great Aſſize to be arbitrary and illegal, whilſt it opens a Way to Man's Happineſs, by an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49679:120"/>Holineſs, which has nothing to do with the Cauſe, upon which alone his Trial depends. For, a Reward <hi>conferr'd</hi> in another World, upon an Holineſs <hi>infuſed</hi> in another World, does in no wiſe look back to, or paſs a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Life that was <hi>led</hi> in this World. But becauſe we know aſſuredly, and that by many expreſs Teſtimonies of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that that will be the Work of the Laſt Day; therefore, for that Reaſon alone, if yet there were no other, we cannot aſcribe a future Happineſs, the happy, juſt, and final Sentence of that Day, to ſuch an infuſed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. No! the Holineſs, for which we are to be rewarded in a <hi>future</hi> Life, muſt be an Obedience practiſed in <hi>this</hi> Life. The Duty is laid upon Man by the Law <hi>here;</hi> and the Reward ſtands engaged to the Performance of ſuch Duty. And if the Righteouſneſs of Man at the Reſurrection be not an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence paid to the Law <hi>then,</hi> when the Law <hi>required</hi> ſuch Obedience; the Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the Law can in no wiſe belong to <hi>ſuch</hi> Righteouſneſs. And therefore, to fanſie a Reward for an Holineſs, in which the Law is not at all concerned, (as it is not in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Holineſs) is to have no regard to the Law at all. For, Happineſs beſtowed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of an infuſed Holineſs, may as <hi>well</hi> be granted <hi>without</hi> the Law, as <hi>with</hi> it; nay, indeed much <hi>better:</hi> Becauſe, had there been no Law at all, then ſuch a Management had
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49679:121"/>not affronted the Law: Whereas the Law ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been once ſetled, to beſtow the Reward promiſed by the Law upon an Holineſs, which has no Eye to the Law, (as an infuſed Holineſs has not) is to ſlight and overlook the Law; for it allows the Law to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the Allotment of ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>It may be plauſibly objected in this Place, That while I vindicate the Cauſe which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, againſt one Adverſary, I give it up to another: Becauſe, while I aſſert, That every Man ſhall at the laſt Day be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Behaviour in <hi>this</hi> World, I do in effect refer the Reward, that ſhall then be adjudged to Believers, to ſuch <hi>their</hi> Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; that is, in the preſent Caſe, to <hi>their Obedience</hi> in this World: And that, becauſe I do ſo, I therefore pull down with one Hand that which before I had ſet up with another, <hi>viz.</hi> the Imputation of their Saviour's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in order to their Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But this Objection is grounded upon a Miſtake; which Miſtake is, that the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſuppoſes an Oppoſition between the imperfect Obedience of Believers, and the Imputation of their Saviour's Righteouſneſs; from which ſuppoſed Oppoſition, it infers, That if Salvation <hi>be</hi> beſtowed upon them in conſideration of the <hi>one,</hi> that it <hi>cannot</hi> for that Reaſon be beſtowed in conſideration of the <hi>other.</hi> And indeed, ſuch a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49679:121"/>being granted, the Inference would be good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But then, ſecondly, we do aſſert and maintain, That there is no ſuch Oppoſition between the Imputation, and the imperfect Obedience of Believers, as that Salvation muſt be disjunctively beſtowed in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one, in oppoſition to, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the other. For, tho' we allow a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's imperfect Obedience to be a <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi> yet we do not allow it to be the <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious</hi> Cauſe of Man's Salvation; that is, tho' he ſhall have the Benefit of the <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> in conſideration of his <hi>ſincere,</hi> but <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience; yet he ſhall only obtain his <hi>Salvation</hi> in conſideration of ſuch <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> For, <hi>Juſtice</hi> only beſtows the Reward there, where it is <hi>deſerved;</hi> and to beſtow it elſewhere, may be called Mercy, or may be called Favour; but cannot, either in propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Speech or Truth, be called Juſtice. Since therefore it is our preſent Buſineſs, to maintain that Method, in which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows not only Pardon of Sin, but over and above an eternal Happineſs, to be juſt; and ſince, in order to its being ſo, it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to his Law, which is ſo; or elſe the Law cannot be fulfilled; and ſince, laſtly, the Law does not aſſign its Reward to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Obedience; (For, it requires a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not an imperfect Obedience; and its Reward can and does only belong to what
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49679:122"/>it requires, not to what it does not require.) Since, I ſay, the Caſe ſtands thus; it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is only beſtowed upon the Saviour's, that is, upon a perfect Obedience, to which alone by the Law it does belong; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Execution of the Law, in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of its Reward, is juſt: And, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> That becauſe (as we have already proved) ſuch his perfect Obedience is juſtly imputed to Believers, in conſideration of their ſincere, tho' imperfect Obedience; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as by <hi>his</hi> Obedience alone they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the <hi>Reward,</hi> ſo, according to the Tenor of the Goſpel, by their <hi>own</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they are entitled to <hi>His.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Believers come to be judged in <hi>another</hi> World, according to what <hi>they</hi> have done in <hi>this,</hi> the Enquiry ſhall not be, Whether by their <hi>Life led</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, they have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an <hi>eternal</hi> Happineſs in <hi>that?</hi> (for that needs no Enquiry, becauſe it is moſt certain in it ſelf, and confeſſed on all Sides, that they have not:) But their Trial ſhall be, Whether their Obedience in this Life, tho' imperfect, (and therefore in it ſelf undeſerving of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs) be ſuch, as may ſo far enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them to their Saviour's Purchaſe, as that his Obedience may be imputed to them, in order to their obtaining ſuch Purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>I have therefore purſued this Thing the farther, becauſe the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, as much as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49679:122"/>in them lies, vilifie the <hi>Imputation</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Righteouſneſs; for by that Means they gain great Advantages, to run down the Doctrine of the Expiation. And yet too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our own People do here cloſe with them; and do not, to me, ſeem to diſcern the miſchievous Conſequences that will fall upon the whole Doctrine of Redemption, if once our Saviour's Obedience be excluded from being the meritorious Cauſe of Man's Salvation. For, as to my ſelf, I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent very well ſatisfied, that if the Law had never been fulfilled by Obedience, the Breach of it had never been expiated by any Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted for ſuch Breach whatſoever. For, God's Deſign in promulging his Law was, that it ſhould be <hi>obeyed.</hi> For, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that it cannot be indifferent to him, whether we <hi>obey</hi> what the Law commands, or ſuffer what it <hi>threatens.</hi> No! his Deſign is, that we ſhould be holy, and ſafe: Such a Deſign flows from his Nature, and is an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his eſſential Bounty and Goodneſs, and therefore came from him freely, without the Invitation or Sollicitation of any Thing beſides his own Propenſion or Inclination. But Judgment, that is, Puniſhment for the Breach of his Law, is his <hi>ſtrange Work,</hi> that is, it does not come from him, as his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bounty does, freely and ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; but is extorted from him by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition and Provocation of Sin. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49679:123"/>therefore the principal and more natural Deſign of his Law, it is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that his Law ſhould be <hi>obeyed;</hi> for there is no <hi>other</hi> way of <hi>fulfilling</hi> of it. And therefore He who told us, that <hi>not one Jot or Tittle of it ſhould fail;</hi> told us likewiſe, that <hi>he came to fulfil it:</hi> Fulfil it, not only as the <hi>Antitype</hi> of it, but likewiſe as a <hi>Subject</hi> to it. The Law then was fulfilled by our Saviour's Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and by his Obedience alone: For all the reſt of Mankind broke it. And had he not fulfilled it by obeying it, the Vengeance of it had always continued: For, it muſt have continued, ſo long as it was juſtly due; and it muſt be juſtly due, ſo long as the Law remains broken, and not obeyed. We owe our <hi>Reward</hi> therefore to our Saviour's <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as we do our <hi>Redemption</hi> to his <hi>Death.</hi> Nay, which is more, and more direct to our Text, becauſe the Law muſt of <hi>neceſſity</hi> be obeyed, and becauſe He <hi>alone</hi> did obey it; therefore, for that Reaſon, as well as for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, <hi>there is not Salvation in any other.</hi> I would deſire them, whom it chiefly concerns, ſeriouſly to conſider it.</p>
                     <p>And now having ſeen what Reaſon ſays to the Doctrine of our Saviour's Imputed Righteouſneſs; the next Thing to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe the next Thing propoſed, will be to ſee, what the Scriptures ſay to it. In order to which, take we notice in the</p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:49679:123"/>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt place, That our Saviour, at his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, did take upon him the ſame Fleſh and Blood with us Men. For, becauſe he, the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and we, do both of us derive from one and the ſame ſingle and common Stock, <hi>Adam;</hi> and becauſe we are ſeveral Propagations and Branches from that one Stock; therefore we may be truly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, becauſe in reality ſo we are, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and diſtinct Parcels of that common Fleſh and Blood, out of which all Mankind are made. But tho' the Son of God became <hi>Man,</hi> in order to be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of Man; and tho' he was made of the ſame <hi>Blood</hi> with all Men, in order to his becoming <hi>Man;</hi> yet becauſe we know, that the diſtinct Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of this common Fleſh and Blood have, and that juſtly too, very different and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contrary Allotments of Juſtice; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we take notice,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, That all thoſe, who, according to his Goſpel, are ſincere and penitent, are ſecure of having the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of his Spirit. And then, tho' that Fleſh and Blood, of which they with him are made Partakers, be <hi>common</hi> to all Mankind beſides; yet by ſuch <hi>Communications</hi> it is ſo far <hi>particularized,</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) as that in the eſtimation of the Goſpel, thoſe who enjoy ſuch Communications do become a Part of <hi>himſelf.</hi> And hence it is, that ſuch People are in the Scripture ſaid to be <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49679:124"/>of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones;</hi> and that he is ſo often, in the ſame Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, called <hi>their Head.</hi> And we may know, that he himſelf does ſo account them, becauſe he reckons thoſe Kindneſſes, which are done to his diſtreſſed People, as done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf. Theſe Things then being ſo, how does the Scripture teach us to reaſon upon them in relation to our preſent Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Why, as Sin was the Tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> entailed upon all his <hi>Poſterity,</hi> becauſe the Covenant was made with <hi>him,</hi> and with all his <hi>Seed;</hi> for, <hi>all Mankind</hi> (as the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks in the like Caſe) <hi>were in the Loins of Adam in the Day of his Tranſgreſſion:</hi> So Believers, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their Saviour, being regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit, and ſo becoming the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of ſuch their <hi>Saviour</hi> does ſo belong to <hi>them,</hi> who are his <hi>Seed,</hi> [See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.] as <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Sin</hi> did to <hi>his.</hi> And therefore, in him they are the Sons of God, and the Heirs of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And to this very purpoſe, and in this very manner too, (if I be not very much miſtaken) the Apoſtle argues, in the Fifth to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the Nineteenth Verſe: <hi>For, as by one Mans</hi> Diſobedience <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were made</hi> Sinners; <hi>ſo by the</hi> Obedience <hi>of one ſhall many be made</hi> Righteous. And we may ſafely pronounce it, that the Parallel of the Apoſtle would be no Parallel at all, if
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49679:124"/>the <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not ſo affect Men in reference to their <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> did to their <hi>Corruption.</hi> And therefore, the ſame Apoſtle tells us, in the Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. That <hi>Chriſt is made to us Wiſdom, and</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>and</hi> Sanctification, <hi>and</hi> Redemption. And the ſame Apoſtle ſtill, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his <hi>own</hi> Righteouſneſs, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it would not avail him for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of <hi>that Happineſs</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> promiſed, does confide only in <hi>that</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is <hi>through Faith in Chriſt,</hi> in the Third to the <hi>Philippians, ver.</hi> 9. And in another Place, we are ſaid to be <hi>made the</hi> Righteouſneſs <hi>of God in</hi> him; and, in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> he is twice called <hi>the Lord</hi> our <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> Other Places might be produced, which, tho' they have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to a different Senſe; yet, by that Light which has been already offered, it does appear, that they do more than barely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance what we now maintain, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Saviour's Obedience ſhall be made ours; and how it ſhall be made ſo. For, what we have ſaid concerning that Intimate Relation between him and his People, will be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Warrant for the Imputation of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to them.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Some Objections anſwered, and ſome Practical Inferences made.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOW beſides thoſe Objections, which lay directly in our Way; and which we were therefore conſtrained to ſpeak to, in order to clear and open our Paſſage in the Profecution of the preſent Argument; there are ſome others, which lie againſt our whole Diſcourſe, and which, becauſe we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſo to do, we muſt now ſpeak to apart, and by themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, it is objected againſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of our Saviour's Righteouſneſs, That ſuch his Righteouſneſs, which is meant in the preſent Caſe, is his Obedience to the Law, and that his Obedience to the Law does conſiſt in the Conformity of his Actions to the Law. His Obedience therefore being lodged in his Actions, unleſs his Actions can be made ours, it is impoſſible, that his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhould be ſo. For, ſo long as the Actions of one Man are not the Actions of any other Man; ſo long it muſt and will be true, that the Obedience, which is only paid by ſuch Actions, and which is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly lodged in ſuch Actions, cannot be that others neither. This is the Subſtance of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49679:125"/>the Objection, which might be put in more Words; but becauſe I think the full Force of it is ſufficiently expreſſed in what we have ſpoken, therefore it needs not.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Now, in order to clear this matter, we obſerve, firſt, That the Right which <hi>one</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has in a Thing, may be made over, or transferred to <hi>another</hi> Perſon, by the <hi>delivery</hi> of ſuch Thing to him; provided, that he who delivers it, do ſome way or other ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that it is his <hi>Mind,</hi> by ſuch his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, to <hi>transfer</hi> ſuch his Right: Where we muſt take notice of Two Things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That bare Delivery of the Thing, without ſuch Signification, does not alter the Right in ſuch Thing: For, in ſuch Caſe, the <hi>Thing</hi> being only transfer'd <hi>naturally,</hi> but not <hi>legally,</hi> the <hi>Right</hi> in it is not transferred with it. Take the Thing in an Inſtance. A Man puts a Purſe of Money into another Man's Hand, who ſtands by him, to hold it. In this Caſe, the Purſe and Money is <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> transferr'd from one Man to another; but tho' it be naturally transferr'd, yet it is not (for all that) <hi>legally</hi> transferr'd: For, the Alteration of the <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> does not in the Caſe alter the <hi>Right;</hi> and ſo, tho the <hi>Money be</hi> removed from one Man to another, yet the <hi>Propriety</hi> in the Money is <hi>not.</hi> On the other Side, one Man by Deed of Gift, or ſome other legal and ſufficient Conveyance, makes <hi>over</hi> his <hi>Right</hi> in the Purſe of Money
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49679:126"/>to another, but ſtill <hi>keeps</hi> the Money in his own <hi>Poſſeſſion:</hi> In ſuch a Caſe, tho' the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney be not <hi>naturally,</hi> or <hi>locally,</hi> (call it which you pleaſe) transferr'd or made over to that other, yet it is <hi>legally</hi> ſo. For, tho' the <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> remain in the <hi>Donor;</hi> yet the <hi>Right</hi> is transferr'd to, and therefore is in the <hi>Donee.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> Thing to be obſerved in this Caſe, is, that that Thing, whoſe Right is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd by Delivery, muſt be ſomething which is capable (as our Law ſpeaks) of Manual Occupation. For, tho' the Right to ſome Things may be transferr'd by Delivery; yet the Right to others cannot be ſo transferr'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, therefore, The Right in a Thing may be transferr'd from one Perſon to another by <hi>Deed,</hi> or any proper and legal <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of Conveyance <hi>there,</hi> where the Nature of the Thing is ſuch, that the <hi>Thing</hi> it ſelf cannot be transferr'd by <hi>Delivery.</hi> And ſuch a Thing (for Inſtance) is a Privilege: For, we may beſtow upon another a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, which of Right belongs to our ſelves, and, by ſo doing, may give him a Right in ſuch Privilege; tho' we cannot ſo put him in the poſſeſſion of it, as we can do of a Ring, or a Garment. Such a Thing then may be <hi>legally</hi> and <hi>rightfully</hi> transferr'd to another, tho' (becauſe it is not capable of Manual Occupation) it cannot be transferr'd <hi>locally</hi> or <hi>naturally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:49679:126"/>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Where a Thing not capable of Manual Occupation does ſo inſeparably by Law belong to one, that it cannot but do ſo, without Breach of the Law; yet even ſuch a Thing ſhall by Act of Law be ſo imputed to another, that that other ſhall receive the Benefits, or ſuffer the Miſchiefs, which legally flow from ſuch Thing, as if the Thing it ſelf, which was the Cauſe of ſuch Benefits or Miſchiefs, had been his own. And ſuch are the Actions of ſome Perſons, when they ſtand in ſome ſorts of Relations to other Perſons. And, to come up a little cloſer to our preſent Deſign; it is a known Practice in our own Law, the Law of <hi>England,</hi> that in <hi>ſome,</hi> if not <hi>many</hi> Caſes, the Actions of the Wife ſhall be ſo reckoned the Actions of the Husband; and, in ſome Caſes, the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Husband ſhall be ſo reckoned the Actions of the Wiſe, that they ſhall, and that too by Law, receive the Advantages, and ſuffer the Diſadvantages, of each others Actions. And I do the rather inſtance in this Caſe, (tho' ſeveral others might be offered) becauſe we know, that the Scriptures do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly tell us, that the Saviour is ſo the Head of his Body, the Church, as the Husband is the Head of the Wife.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Things being laid down, in order to make plain what is now to follow,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is to be obſerved, in the firſt place, That the whole Tranſaction of Man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49679:127"/>is managed by way of Covenant; that is, it is managed in a <hi>judicial</hi> or <hi>legal,</hi> not in a <hi>natural</hi> way. This is as notorious, as it is, that the Tranſaction is carried on by mutual <hi>Obligations</hi> of the reſpective Parties engaged, by <hi>Promiſes,</hi> by <hi>Rewards,</hi> by <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> and the like. It appears likewiſe by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are <hi>legal,</hi> not <hi>natural</hi> Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of thoſe Graces or Bleſſings, of which they are the Pledges. For, Water in Baptiſm does not <hi>naturally</hi> waſh away Sin; nor are the Bread and Wine <hi>natural</hi> Seals or Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Covenant in the Sacrament: They only give us a Title to the Benefits of it, as the Delivery of a Deed, a Turf, or a Wand, do to an Eſtate: That is, they are only legal Ways of Conveyance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do loudly proclaim a Covenant.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Tranſaction of Man's Salvation being managed by way of Covenant, (that is, in a legal or judicial, not in a natural way) tho' it be granted, that the Obedience of one Man cannot <hi>naturally</hi> be made over to another; yet it will not from thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it may not therefore be made over <hi>judicially,</hi> or in a <hi>legal</hi> way. Nay! by what has been ſaid already, it is notorious, that it may be ſo made over. And therefore, beſides the Inſtance already offered between an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, (which will in the Scripture-Account as well belong to our Saviour and Believers) it is in ſome Caſes the agreed Senſe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49679:127"/>of Mankind, that he who does not hinder the bad Action of another, when it is in his Power, (at leaſt, when it <hi>is</hi> his <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and ſo <hi>ought</hi> to be his <hi>Care</hi> ſo to do) by not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it, does in Law make ſuch bad Action his own: That is, the Action in Law ſhall be ſo imputed to him, as if he himſelf had done it; and he ſhall accordingly be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the juſt and legal Conſequences of it. And then, if the <hi>ill</hi> Action of one Man may (in a judicial way) be juſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to another, and ſo be rated as that others; then there can be no good Reaſon, why the <hi>good</hi> Actions of one Man may not be juſtly ſo rated and imputed likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>All therefore that the Objection offers, is, That one Man's <hi>Action</hi> (be that Action Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or what it will) cannot <hi>naturally</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or be made the Action of any other Man: But that it may not <hi>legally</hi> or <hi>judicially</hi> become ſo to all Intents and Purpoſes of Law, whether of Rewards or Puniſhments, as it does not affirm it, ſo, ſhould it do ſo, it may, for the Reaſons offered, be truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, becauſe in deed and truth it is falſe.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more to this Matter hereafter; and therefore ſhall not purſue it any further here. Only one Remark I would leave upon it, and that is this: That it is too frequent a Practice, when Men diſcourſe upon Points of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to treat of ſuch Points rather as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49679:128"/>
                        <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> than as <hi>Lawyers,</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines:</hi> That is, that I may ſpeak my Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as plain as I can, they fall upon the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the Things, of which they diſcourſe; and ſo argue from their <hi>Natural</hi> Properties, Qualities, and Powers; and from thence draw ſuch Concluſions, which (tho' they call them Theological) yet have nothing to do with Divinity, or indeed with the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Whereas they ſhould treat of thoſe Things, which are concerned in <hi>Religion,</hi> in a <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>judicial</hi> way: They ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, what Relation and Regard they have to that Holy Covenant; how far they agree with, or differ from the Deſign and Purport of it; and, by conſequence, what Share they have, or what Influence they <hi>may</hi> or may <hi>not</hi> have, for the hindring or promoting, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing its Deſigns. The Caſe under our preſent Conſideration will make my Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill plainer: For, they who tell us, that our Saviour's Obedience cannot be made over to Man, becauſe it conſiſts in Action, and becauſe one Man's Action cannot, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, be made over to another; do only diſcourſe of his Obedience in a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Senſe, that is, as <hi>Natural</hi>-Philoſophers; but do not diſcourſe of it in a <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Senſe, that is, as <hi>Divines,</hi> or <hi>Lawyers:</hi> And becauſe they do not, therefore they ſtart from the Buſineſs of <hi>Religion;</hi> and ſo inſtead of diſcourſing of the <hi>Chriſtian Covenant,</hi> they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49679:128"/>give us a Lecture concerning the Nature and Properties of <hi>Animal</hi> Motions and <hi>Powers:</hi> And, in the mean time, overlook that that is, or, at leaſt, ſhould be their Buſineſs, which is, the legal or judicial Conſideration of ſuch Obedience; as, what Relation it has to the Law; what Influence it has by Law upon the Perſon whoſe Obedience it is, or upon others; how far the Merit and Deſert of it may go, and the like. And, to come cloſe to the Buſineſs we have been all this while upon, Becauſe Imputation is an Act of <hi>Law,</hi> and not of <hi>Nature,</hi> to undertake to overthrow the Poſſibility of it by the Laws and Rules of <hi>natural</hi> Motions or Actions, is much the ſame thing, as to attempt to open a difficult Place of Scripture with a Knife, or a Saw: The Things are of different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and there is no Congruity in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the one, for the Reſolution of the other. And I am very well ſatisfied, that the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had never been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> if the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts had never heard of nor read either <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or his Commentators, concerning <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Accident.</hi> It was the jumbling of his Natural Philoſophy, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion together, that produced the Monſter. Nay, which is yet ſomething more; had they been trained up in any other ſort of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, they had been very well ſatisfied and contented without that new and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49679:129"/>uncouth Article of their Chriſtian Faith. Other Inſtances might be produced to ſhew, that groſs Fooleries and Corruptions have crept into Religion at this Door. Whereas a due Conſideration, that the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a Covenant, and the treating of it as ſuch, would acquaint us much better with the Nature, and engage us more effectually to the Duties of it. But this uſeful Remark being left in this place, we proceed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond Objection therefore againſt the Imputation of our Saviour's Obedience to Believers, in order to their obtaining the promiſed Reward of the Covenant, ſtands thus: That ſuppoſing, that our Saviour did provide for the <hi>Directive</hi> Part of the Law by his <hi>Obedience;</hi> and that he did alſo fulfil the <hi>Vindictive</hi> Part by his <hi>Death:</hi> In ſuch Caſe, there does therefore ſeem to be a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity</hi> in his Proviſion; becauſe, ſhould his <hi>Obedience</hi> alone be imputed to us, we ſhould by that Means be entitled to a perfect <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> and then there had been no need of his Death to expiate our Sins, becauſe then we ſhould have had no Sins to be expiated. And that which may add ſome Strength to what is thus alledged, is this: That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour paying that Obedience to the Law, while he was in the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> the <hi>Obedience</hi> ſo paid was <hi>paid before</hi> his Death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Courſe of Things, it ſhould ſeem, that it might be <hi>imputed before</hi> his Death,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49679:129"/>and, in the Courſe of <hi>Juſtice, without</hi> it. For, when by ſuch Imputation we were once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to his Righteouſneſs, the Plea of his Death, in order to qualifie us for Happineſs, muſt needs be uſeleſs and ſuperfluous.</p>
                     <p>Now, tho' it may ſeem indeed, that Things might <hi>have</hi> gone ſo, if we only have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Order of Time; yet if we look to the Order of Reaſon and Juſtice, we ſhall eaſily perceive, that they could <hi>not.</hi> For, we cannot by any Eſtimation of Juſtice what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever be reckoned Righteous, ſo long as our Guilt lies upon us; and, when once by our Sins we have made our ſelves guilty, ſuch Guilt muſt needs lie upon us, till it be one way or other expiated. Now, becauſe we have already and fully made it out, that it neither is, nor can be expiated any other way, than by the Death of our Saviour; therefore the Death of ſuch Saviour muſt, in the Order of Juſtice, <hi>firſt</hi> expiate ſuch our Guilt, <hi>before</hi> we can poſſibly be entitled to a perfect Righteouſneſs. For, who can put a clean thing into an unclean? It is neither agreeable to the Methods of Wiſdom or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo to do: And therefore we may be ſure, that it cannot be the Practice of the moſt Wiſe and Juſt <hi>God.</hi> No! we know well enough, becauſe we are told ſo by the Spirit of God, that our Saviour <hi>firſt died for our Sins,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> that <hi>roſe again for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> And we know moreover, that when
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49679:130"/>God had once given forth his Law, tho', had an exact Obedience been paid to it, the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of it, which was only Conditionally threatned, had never been executed, (for, the Juſtice and Execution of ſuch Vengeance does entirely depend upon our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;) yet <hi>after</hi> we had tranſgreſſed the Law, the Execution of ſuch Vengeance was as <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> as was the <hi>Happineſs</hi> promiſed, if we had <hi>not</hi> tranſgreſſed it. For, Vengeance does, by the Tenor of the Law, ſtand in the ſame Relation to Sin, as Happineſs does to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The firſt becomes our Due, in caſe we neglect our Duty; the laſt, in caſe we perform it. And the Diſtribution both of the one and the other, muſt as neceſſarily follow, upon our Performance or Non-performance of thoſe Conditions to which each of them do ſtand reſpectively engaged, as it is neceſſary for God to love Holineſs, and hate Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. One Part of the Law therefore is in Juſtice to be provided for, as well as the other. And then, if neither the Puniſhment of Man could fulfil the Law, on the one Hand; nor the imperfect Obedience of Man, on the other; and if our Saviour undertook for Man's ſake to ſupply Man's Defects; then there was the ſame Neceſſity in Juſtice, that he ſhould fulfil the <hi>Vindictive</hi> Part of it, by his <hi>Death;</hi> that there was, that he ſhould fulfil the <hi>Directive</hi> Part of it, by his <hi>Obedience.</hi> And therefore, as neither his Obedience, not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49679:130"/>his Death, had been neceſſary, (no, nor his Incarnation neither, upon which ſuch his Death, and ſuch his Obedience do depend:) But, I ſay, as neither his Obedience nor his Death had been neceſſary, if Man had obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law himſelf; ſo, upon Man's Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, they both became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: Becauſe, as we have already ſeen, Man's Puniſhment is in Juſtice as neceſſary upon his Breach of the Law, as his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was upon God's Promulgation of the Law. And therefore, when our Saviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſave ſinful Man, that is, Man who had <hi>tranſgreſſed</hi> the <hi>Directions</hi> of the Law, and Man who lay <hi>expoſed</hi> to the <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> of the Law; it was neceſſary, in order to his doing ſo <hi>juſtly,</hi> that he ſhould have a Regard to <hi>one</hi> Part of the Law, as well as to the <hi>other;</hi> that is, that he ſhould fulfil the <hi>Vindictive</hi> by his <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Directive</hi> by his <hi>Obedience.</hi> And had he not <hi>done</hi> both, one Part of the Law (at leaſt) had been neglected, and ſo the Redemption had not been juſt. By which we may by this time underſtand, that there is no Superfluity in his providing for Man's Salvation, both by the <hi>Obedience</hi> of his Life, and by the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of his Death. For, that <hi>cannot</hi> in Reaſon be accounted Superfluous in the doing of any Thing whatſoever, without which ſuch Thing cannot be done <hi>juſtly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:49679:131"/>
                     <p>Now, as in our Anſwer to the <hi>former</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, we made good not only the <hi>Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> but the <hi>Legality</hi> too of the Imputation of our Saviour's Righteouſneſs; ſo, in our Anſwer to <hi>this,</hi> we have ſhewed the <hi>conjunct</hi> Neceſſity both of the Imputation, and of his Death, in order to Man's Salvation. By all which, we may at laſt come to underſtand, that God in his Counſel for Man's Salvation, as he conſulted his Mercy, ſo did not lay aſide the Care of his Juſtice. For, the whole Tranſaction, as we have largely ſeen, was in <hi>him, Juſtice;</hi> as it was to <hi>us, Mercy: Juſtice,</hi> as it fulfilled the <hi>whole</hi> Law; <hi>Mercy,</hi> as it redeemed us from the <hi>Curſe,</hi> and inveſted us in the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the Law. A ſtrange Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! and (had it not been diſcovered to us by Revelation) by our Natural Reaſon not to be fathomed: But, as it is revealed, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as we have ſeen, to ſuch Reaſon ſo aſſiſted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By which we may, in the firſt place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, That tho' <hi>Chriſt crucified be to the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs;</hi> yet to us he is (and that notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) <hi>the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God.</hi> For, his Wiſdom and his Power can, we ſee, bring Things to paſs beyond the reach of Angels and Devils, and therefore much more beyond the reach of ſhort-ſighted Man: And yet by his Light he <hi>can,</hi> becauſe he <hi>has,</hi> inſtructed us, that ſuch Things are
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49679:131"/>not only the Effects of an Almighty <hi>Power,</hi> but of an Almighty <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> of an Almighty <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and of an Almighty <hi>Mercy</hi> too. For, in the Buſineſs of Man's Salvation, as in all Things elſe, he does ſo diſplay his Attributes, as that they never claſh nor interfere. His Mercy does not fight againſt his Juſtice, nor his Juſtice againſt his Mercy; and neither fights againſt his Wiſdom. By the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore of the Chriſtian Religion God has admitted us to a nearer View of his Dealings with the Children of Men, and has, at leaſt, communicated ſo much of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to us, as may aſſiſt us (if we be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſelves) to <hi>provide</hi> for our own everlaſting <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Security;</hi> and to <hi>vindicate</hi> and aſſert his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> Let us therefore thankfully receive the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as it is graciouſly offered; and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to regulate his Revelations by our fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reaſon; but guide our Reaſon by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations. For, we know, that he can do more than we can; and therefore alſo we may know, that he can guide us better, than we can guide our ſelves. And becauſe he has vouchſafed in Mercy ſo to do, it will but very ill ſort with that Deference we owe him, to do, as too many now-a-days do, that is, to return from <hi>Revealed</hi> to <hi>Natural</hi> Religion, and ſo to walk in Paths, not only of our own <hi>chuſing;</hi> but, many times, of our own <hi>making</hi> too. For, ſince the <hi>Day-Star from
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49679:132"/>on High hath viſited us,</hi> it is our Duty, as to guide our <hi>Lives,</hi> ſo to guide our <hi>Faith</hi> by that Light which it affords us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Since we can only be ſaved in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our Obedience to the Law, and ſince none of us have paid ſuch Obedience; and ſo, if we ſtand the Award of our own Deſerts, we muſt needs fall ſhort of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I ſay, ſince Things are ſo, we ought with Heart and Voice to praiſe our Saviour, who by an Infinite Condeſcenſion both obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to obey the Law, and ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately united us to himſelf, as to entitle us to his Obedience, by which we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For, as there is no other way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Salvation, but by Obedience; ſo <hi>there is no other Name given but his, whereby we muſt be ſaved;</hi> and therefore we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that that Obedience, by which we muſt be ſaved, is his. His Love to <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> then made his Obedience <hi>perfect;</hi> and his Love to <hi>us</hi> made his Obedience <hi>ours;</hi> and Both (if we be not wanting to our ſelves) will make our Condition happy and ſecure. And then ſurely our Security and Happineſs, as they do very well deſerve, ſo they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Thankſgiving. For, we therefore ſtand bound to be grateful to, and to love the Author of our Happineſs, becauſe we find, that we cannot but love our ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As we cannot be ſaved without our Saviour's Righteouſneſs; ſo, as we deſire our
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49679:132"/>own Safety, we ſhould heartily endeavour to <hi>qualifie</hi> our ſelves to be made Partakers of ſuch his Righteouſneſs. And we may be ſure, that our <hi>Deſire,</hi> at leaſt, after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and our <hi>Good-will</hi> to entertain it, are neceſſary even for our obtaining the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; becauſe it cannot in any Senſe be ours, if we be not <hi>willing</hi> that it ſhould be ſo. We muſt be therefore <hi>diſabled</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> it, if we be <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>entertain</hi> it. So much Righteouſneſs God requires of us, in order to our being entitled to a perfect Righteouſneſs. I know, that <hi>ſome</hi> Divines do <hi>ſpeak</hi> of Irreſiſtible Grace, and that ſome <hi>few</hi> do <hi>defend</hi> it: That is, in a few Words, they make God, by the arbitrary Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own Pleaſure, to beſtow Grace upon ſome Men, whether they will or no, and even againſt their Inclinations. And, to make good what they ſo maintain, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Converſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſuch like Caſes. But tho' St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome others, have been converted by Miracle; yet we know well enough, that Miracles wrought for the ſelf-ſame purpoſe, have not always been attended with Succeſs; and that the Miracles even of our Saviour himſelf, and thoſe too wrought before their Eyes, did fail of their deſigned Effect, and that, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, upon the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And we know not the Hearts of Men, nor the <hi>inward,</hi> but <hi>real</hi> Preparations of Soul,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49679:133"/>that may duely qualifie them to admit God's Grace. But we do know, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought verily, that he ought to do as he did: And then, tho' he was <hi>defective</hi> in his Knowledge, yet becauſe he <hi>acted according</hi> to ſuch Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he was therefore <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> in his <hi>Practice.</hi> And then, if God in <hi>pity</hi> to his <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and in <hi>approbation</hi> of his <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> did reward that Sincerity with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Direction for the <hi>guidance</hi> of his Practice; we may from thence be taught, that his Grace was ſuited to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Will. For, he willed that <hi>after</hi> the Miracle, which he willed <hi>before</hi> it; that is, he willed that, which he took to be good. And indeed, we may as well think any <hi>other</hi> Creature to be capable of Righteouſneſs, as we may think <hi>Man</hi> to be ſo without his <hi>own</hi> Will and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Let us therefore take care, that we <hi>will</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> to obey God's Law, that is, to be righteous; if we deſign, that God our Saviour ſhould <hi>make</hi> us ſo: For, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>be</hi> like him, unleſs we are <hi>willing</hi> to be ſo. He therefore who would appear at the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Supper of the Lamb, muſt take care to waſh and <hi>cleanſe himſelf from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> in order to his putting on the Wedding-Garment. For, as they only ſhall be pronounced <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> who ſhall be found <hi>Righteous;</hi> ſo they only ſhall be found <hi>ſo,</hi> who do ſincerely <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> to be ſo.</p>

                           <hi>The Firſt and General Propoſition aſſerted from all that has been ſaid: That the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a Goſpel-Salvation, as laid down in the Scriptures, is agreeable to the allowed Practices of Mankind in their Legal or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Proceedings; and is worded in the Scriptures accordingly.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND now having gone ſo far, before we proceed any farther, we ſhall bring all that we have hitherto ſpoken, to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign at the Beginning; and by ſo doing, ſhall endeavour to make it out, That <hi>there is not Salvation in any other, but in Jeſus Chriſt alone;</hi> and, That <hi>there is no other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. And to do this, we ſhall firſt ſhew, That no other, but our Saviour alone, could ſo ſuffer for Sin, as to obtain a Releaſe from the Penalty, which the Law had threatned againſt it: Or, which is much one and the ſame Thing, That no one, but our Saviour <hi>alone,</hi> could make an <hi>Expiation</hi> for the Sin of Man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And, ſecondly, That no one, but our Saviour <hi>alone,</hi> could, by an exact Obedience to the Law, <hi>purchaſe</hi> that <hi>Reward,</hi> the Gift
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49679:134"/>of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> which the Law had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuch Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Now, in order to our making good our firſt Propoſition, we muſt examine, what <hi>Qualifications</hi> are abſolutely neceſſary, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fit any one to make ſuch Purchaſe; and then enquire farther, Whether ſuch Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications either do or can belong to any <hi>other,</hi> beſides our <hi>Saviour</hi> alone.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Now the firſt and leading Qualification in him, who ſhall be fitted for the Purchaſe of a Releaſe from the Penalty of the Law, which they have incurred, who tranſgreſs the Law, is, that he, who makes ſuch a Purchaſe, muſt be one of the <hi>ſame</hi> Kind with <hi>them</hi> to whom the Law was given; that is, in the preſent Caſe, muſt be a <hi>Man.</hi> For, the Law was given to <hi>Man,</hi> was broke by <hi>Man;</hi> and therefore alſo the Breach of it, in the Congruity of Things, and by the Laws of Common Senſe and Juſtice, is to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Man.</hi> Now, tho' our Saviour was not the only Perſon in the World, who had this Qualification, (for every Man beſides is as real a Man, as he was) yet he was the only Man among all Mankind, who by this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification was <hi>fitted</hi> for the effectual <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing</hi> and bring to <hi>paſs</hi> thoſe other Things, which are abſolutely neceſſary for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the Releaſe ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For, ſecondly, The next Qualification of him, who is fitted for the Purchaſe of a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49679:134"/>Releaſe from the Penalty of the Law, is, that he muſt be an <hi>Innocent</hi> Man. He was to be <hi>a Lamb, without Spot or Blemiſh,</hi> and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Paſchal Lamb, which in <hi>this,</hi> as in ſeveral <hi>other</hi> Things, was a Type of that <hi>Lamb of God, which ſhould take away the Sins of the World.</hi> For he, who is qualified to ſuffer for <hi>others,</hi> in order to releaſe thoſe others from the Penalty of Sin, muſt not therefore be a Sinner <hi>himſelf;</hi> becauſe, if he be ſo, then he muſt by the Laws of Juſtice, and even according to the Tenor of that Law, which aſſigns ſuch Penalty, ſuffer the Penalty for his <hi>own</hi> Sin: And he, who ſuffers the Penalty of the Law for his <hi>own</hi> Sin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore ſuffer the Penalty of the Law for the Sin of <hi>others;</hi> at leaſt, in the <hi>preſent</hi> Caſe he cannot; becauſe the Penalty of the Law, upon the Tranſgreſſion of it, being the <hi>loſs</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Penalty exhauſts the <hi>whole</hi> Stock or <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of his ſo ſuffering: For, he who has but one Life, (and no Man has more) can pay that Life but once: And therefore, if he lays it down for his <hi>own</hi> Sin, he muſt for that Reaſon have nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to lay down for the Sin of <hi>others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. He who is duely qualified to purchaſe for Mankind a Releaſe from the Penalty of their Sins, muſt be a Man whoſe Life is of <hi>more value</hi> than the Lives of all the <hi>reſt.</hi> And the Reaſon for it is plain and obvious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know, that the Lives of <hi>all</hi> the reſt
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49679:135"/>can make <hi>no</hi> ſuch Purchaſe: And the <hi>Lives</hi> of all the reſt cannot therefore make any ſuch Purchaſe, becauſe the <hi>Death</hi> of no <hi>ſingle</hi> Man can make ſuch a Purchaſe for <hi>himſelf.</hi> For, what no <hi>ſingle</hi> Man's Death can do for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> that the Death of <hi>all</hi> Men cannot do for <hi>all:</hi> For, there is juſt the ſame Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between <hi>all Men,</hi> and the <hi>Death</hi> of all; that there is between <hi>one</hi> Man, and the <hi>Death</hi> of one. Beſides, ſuppoſing a Man to be a Tranſgreſſor of the Law; it looks very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to affirm, that the <hi>Death</hi> of ſuch a Man, which is the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of his Tranſgreſſion, can be the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of his <hi>Releaſe</hi> from ſuch Puniſhment: For then, the ſelf-ſame Thing (and that is his Death) will bear a quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Character; for, it will be both the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of his <hi>Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of his <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom;</hi> that is, it will be the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of the Law, and the <hi>meritorious Cauſe</hi> of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the ſame Vengeance. Every <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> therefore againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> muſt be a <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer</hi> under the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of the Law; and that Law, which <hi>adjudges</hi> thoſe who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs it, to <hi>Death,</hi> does not, by ſo doing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to <hi>return</hi> them to <hi>Life:</hi> For, if it did, then, by <hi>inflicting</hi> its Sentence, it muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to <hi>revoke</hi> that Sentence, and, by making the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> a <hi>Releaſe</hi> from the Puniſhment, muſt look like <hi>Trifling,</hi> and not like <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Loſs of no Sinner's Life then is of Value ſufficient to put a Period to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49679:135"/>of that Sentence, which the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces againſt thoſe who do tranſgreſs it: And every Man's Death, in the Courſe of the Law, had been eternal, were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to remove it, but his own Strength, that is, in the preſent Caſe, but his own Death. For, if the <hi>Death</hi> of a dead Man can do nothing for him, we are ſure, that no <hi>other</hi> of his Powers or Merits can: For, in the Caſe before us, he can have no <hi>other</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his own to reſtore him to Life, but the Merits of his <hi>Death;</hi> and the Merits of his <hi>Death,</hi> as we have ſeen, are <hi>none</hi> at all. And to expect any Relief from a <hi>dead</hi> Man's Powers, is to expect Relief from <hi>no</hi> Powers at all; for Death cruſhes all the Powers of all Men whom it ſeizes.</p>
                     <p>Now this being the Condition of all Men who die, becauſe they are Sinners, we may from hence ſafely conclude, That if any Man, who is not a Sinner, ſhall <hi>undertake</hi> by his own Death to make good the <hi>Ranſom</hi> of all the reſt from Death, and after that, ſhall <hi>make good</hi> his <hi>Undertaking;</hi> I ſay, if any Man ſhall do this; we may be ſure, that his Death, or his Life, (which you will) is therefore of more Value than the Life or Death of all the reſt, becauſe he does <hi>by</hi> it <hi>make</hi> that Purchaſe, which all the reſt could <hi>not</hi> do by <hi>theirs.</hi> For, in the preſent Caſe, the Value of the Thing may be truly and juſtly eſtimated by the Poſſibility of the Purchaſe it can make;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49679:136"/>becauſe the Poſſibility of the Purchaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Allowance of the Great and Juſt God. And then when God <hi>is</hi> willing to releaſe Man from Death, in Conſideration of the Death of his <hi>Innocent Saviour;</hi> and when he is <hi>not</hi> ſo, in Conſideration of <hi>ſinful Man's own</hi> Death; and when he does profeſſedly declare ſuch his Will in many Places of his <hi>Word,</hi> and by the repeated Atteſtations of Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> whereby ſeveral People have been raiſed from the Dead, in the Name, and by the profeſſed Power of the Saviour: I ſay, when we find all theſe Things to be ſo, (as we <hi>do,</hi> or at leaſt eaſily <hi>may</hi> find them ſo to be) we may from the Whole conclude, That the Death of our Saviour is of more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, than the Death of all Mankind; becauſe <hi>it can</hi> do that, which the <hi>Death</hi> of all the reſt <hi>cannot</hi> do, and that too by the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now, from theſe Propoſitions, ſo laid down, we may therefore conclude, That <hi>there is not Salvation in any other, but only in our Saviour, ſet forth in the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe it was abſolutely neceſſary in Juſtice, that the Law being <hi>broken</hi> by <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> threatned by the Law ſhould be inflicted upon <hi>Man.</hi> For, the <hi>Threatning</hi> of the Law has the ſame Eye, and the ſame neceſſary Relation to the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the Law, that the <hi>Reward</hi> has to the <hi>Obedience</hi> of the Law; and either, the ſame neceſſary
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49679:136"/>Relation to each, that it has to God's Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice. And therefore, ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> as it is, that God ſhould be <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>juſt;</hi> and ſo neceſſary as it is, that he ſhould in his <hi>Laws</hi> be <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>true;</hi> ſo neceſſary alſo it is that the <hi>Vengeance</hi> threatned by his Law ſhould <hi>there</hi> take place, where the <hi>Duty</hi> commanded by the Law is <hi>not</hi> obſerved. Now becauſe no Man, except our Saviour, could ſo undergo the Vengeance of the Law, as without ſuch Saviour's Help to be ever freed from ſuch Vengeance; therefore we do from hence conclude, in the firſt place, That <hi>there is not Salvation in any other, but in our Saviour alone,</hi> as Salvation is taken for our Redemption from the Vengeance and Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe no Man is qualified to ſuffer the Penalty of the Law <hi>ſo,</hi> as by ſuch his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to redeem others, that are Sinners againſt the Law, from <hi>their</hi> ſuffering for their Sin, unleſs he be <hi>Innocent</hi> himſelf; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Man, except our <hi>Saviour,</hi> was ever <hi>Innocent,</hi> that is, no Man, except him alone, did ever fulfil the Law; therefore no Sinner can be ſaved, as Salvation is taken for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from the Vengeance of the Law, but only by the Death of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that is, by the Death of <hi>him,</hi> who was the only <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> Perſon of all Mankind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since the <hi>Death</hi> of all Mankind (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Puniſhment threatned by the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49679:137"/>Law againſt the Tranſgreſſors of it) is not of Value ſufficient to <hi>expiate</hi> the <hi>Sin</hi> of Mankind, whether we conſider their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and their Guilt in the <hi>Groſs</hi> or <hi>Lump,</hi> or whether we conſider it in <hi>Parcels</hi> and <hi>Particulars;</hi> and ſince Death is the neceſſary Puniſhment of the Law; and ſince, laſtly, if there be any Redemption purchaſed from ſuch Penalty, it muſt, for the Reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, be made by a Death of <hi>more</hi> Value than <hi>all</hi> the Deaths of <hi>all</hi> Men: I ſay, from theſe Reaſons in conjunction, we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That <hi>ſuch</hi> a Death is neceſſary for Man's Redemption from the Curſe of the Law. And then, <hi>whoſe</hi> Death that Death was, the Scriptures do ſufficiently acquaint us; for, they expreſly and frequently tell us, that it was the Death of <hi>him,</hi> whom they ſet forth to us as our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And from the Whole, we do infer, in the firſt place, that no other, but our Saviour alone, could ſo ſuffer for Sin, as to obtain a Releaſe from the Penalty which the Law had threatned againſt it; and that therefore <hi>there is no Salvation in any other;</hi> and, that <hi>there is no other Name given under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> as Salvation is taken for our <hi>Redemption</hi> from that Vengeance, which the Law threatens and executes upon the Tranſgreſſors of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond Propoſition therefore laid down at the Beginning, comes next in order
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49679:137"/>to be made good; and that is, That no one, but our Saviour alone, could, by an exact Obedience to the Law, purchaſe that <hi>Reward, Eternal</hi> Life, which the Law has <hi>promiſed</hi> to ſuch Obedience. And to make this good in a few Words, we take notice, in the firſt place, That as the Law, by the ſame Tenor of Juſtice, does engage the promiſed <hi>Reward</hi> to the <hi>Obedience,</hi> as it does the threatned <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> to the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the Law; ſo we may from thence infer, under this Head, That every Man, who will be <hi>Partaker</hi> of ſuch Reward, muſt <hi>pay</hi> ſuch Obedience; as we did under the <hi>laſt,</hi> That every Man, who was <hi>guilty</hi> of ſuch Tranſgreſſion, muſt <hi>ſuffer</hi> ſuch Vengeance. He therefore who does <hi>not</hi> obey the Law, does <hi>loſe</hi> his <hi>Reward,</hi> as certainly, as he who <hi>tranſgreſſes</hi> it does pull upon himſelf his own <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> Now becauſe, among all the Race of Mankind, <hi>no</hi> one, except our Saviour, has <hi>obeyed</hi> the Law; therefore every Man beſides him, when left to the Purchaſe of his own Obedience, has <hi>forfeited</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. No Man therefore does, upon his own Account, deſerve ſuch Reward. And then, becauſe we know, that Juſtice does deal with Men according to their Deſerts; therefore, the Reward being Eternal Life, or Happineſs, every Man, when left to himſelf, has loſt ſuch Happineſs. That Part therefore of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Salvation, which conſiſts in Eternal Life, is not to be expected by any Man, but by the Saviour alone.</p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:49679:138"/>
                     <p>Now, that our Saviour obtained it for himſelf, is not queſtioned. And that it was the Gift of God to others, in Conſideration of his Obedience to that Law, to which others, as well as himſelf, ſtood obliged, we have already, and at large made good. If therefore all <hi>other</hi> Mens obtaining Eternal Life, does not proceed from their <hi>own</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but from their <hi>Saviour's;</hi> then we may now begin to perceive, that <hi>there is not Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other, but in our Saviour alone;</hi> and that too as Salvation is taken in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel for the <hi>Gift of Eternal</hi> Life.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Socinians,</hi> we know, who deny the Salvation of Man to be our Saviour's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, do attempt to elude the Force and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of that Text, which is the Subject of our preſent Diſcourſe, and of ſeveral other expreſs Places of Scripture, which aſſert the ſame Thing with it, by ſtarting the Queſtion, Whether or no God might not, by ſome other Means, have ſaved Mankind, had it pleaſed him ſo to do? And by that Means have (as we obſerved at the Beginning) endeavour'd to alter the Controverſie from Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> to Matter of <hi>Poſſibility;</hi> and to engage others in that ſawcy Diſpute of what God <hi>can</hi> do, and of what God <hi>cannot</hi> do. Whereas it is ſufficient for us to know, what God <hi>has</hi> done; and abundantly ſufficient, when he himſelf does furniſh us with ſuch Knowledge by his own expreſs Word. And if what that Word
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49679:138"/>tells us in the Caſe, be agreeable to our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Sentiments, to that Light which he has afforded us to judge Things by; if moreover it be agreeable to the Common Senſe, that all Men have of Juſtice, (and Juſtice and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this Caſe are the ſame;) if that our Light, which confirms to us the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice of his Proceedings in the preſent Caſe, does by the ſame Meaſures guide all Governments, not only <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but others; and if it be more than a ſhrewd Sign, that becauſe <hi>Mankind</hi> do, and that too in their Laws and Judicial Proceedings, treat <hi>one another,</hi> for the moſt part, as <hi>God</hi> in the preſent Caſe does treat <hi>Mankind,</hi> that they are guided ſo to do by that Light, which he himſelf has afforded them: I ſay, if all theſe Things are ſo; then it may, beſides all that has hitherto been offered, make out the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, at leaſt, very plauſible; That his Dealings with Mankind in and through a Saviour, as we have out of the Scriptures laid it down, are juſt and reaſonable. Let us try the Matter in a ſew Inſtances, which will direct our Meditations to a great many more, and ſee whether the Buſineſs be ſo, or no.</p>
                     <p>The Merits of our Saviour's Death, <hi>we</hi> ſay, and ſo do the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are made over to us. We may add, but we need not, that they are ſo made over by his laſt Will and Teſtament. And, if we do add it, the Scriptures will bear us out in it.</p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:49679:139"/>
                     <p>The Merits of his Obedience alſo are, as we with the Scriptures ſay, made over to us.</p>
                     <p>By the firſt, we obtain Redemption from the Curſe of the Law.</p>
                     <p>By the laſt, an Inheritance with the Saints in Light.</p>
                     <p>Now, what ſays the Light of Nature, when it diſcovers it ſelf in the Practices of Mankind in the like Caſes?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Why, in the firſt place, The Father has ſerved and obliged his Prince by a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Laws, and to himſelf, and by a Defence of both from the diſobedient At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and rebellious or hoſtile Outrages of all others. In ſuch Defence he has been a great Sufferer; has loſt his Eſtate, his Limb, perhaps his Life. The Son of this very Man, guided more by his own <hi>vicious Inclinations,</hi> than by his <hi>Father's Example,</hi> dips his Hand in Treaſon, and thereby forfeits his Life to the Law, and to his Prince. Suppoſe we now, that the Prince grants this Son his Life, in Conſideration of the Father's Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Merits, and ſo cancels the Demerits of the Son, by putting the Deſerts of the Father in the Scale againſt them; which, eſpecially if the Father died in the Prince's Cauſe, is the aſcribing or imputing (which you will) the good Deſerts of one Man to another, who is utterly deſtitute of ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. Now, ſuch a Caſe as this being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; will any Man accuſe the Prince of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49679:139"/>Injuſtice, for the Grant of ſuch a Pardon? Was not the Injury done to himſelf? And may he not remit ſuch an Injury, by eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Services of the Father, and the <hi>Benefits</hi> that <hi>he himſelf</hi> received, and the <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> which the <hi>Father</hi> ſuſtained by ſuch his Services, a ſufficient Counterpoiſe to the Injury of the Son? And may he not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that the near Relation and dear Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Father to the Son, may make the <hi>Son's</hi> Pardon a Gratification and Requital to him for all his <hi>own</hi> Services and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Surely theſe Things may be allowed among Men: And I do not at all queſtion, but that theſe, or ſuch like Things, have been practiſed in all Governments, and yet that their Juſtice has not been taxed for ſuch their Practice. And yet I do aſſert and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That the Pardon of <hi>Man's Sin</hi> in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his <hi>Saviour's Sufferings,</hi> does much more critically and nicely come up to the Rules of an exact Juſtice, than the Pardon of the <hi>Rebel</hi> in the preſent <hi>Inſtance</hi> does; and I am well enough ſatisfied, that what has been already offered, will abundantly make good ſuch an Aſſertion. But ſawcie Man will not allow what his <hi>God</hi> ſays or does to be true and juſt; tho' at the ſame time he will allow and approve the ſame, or the like Practices, in his <hi>Fellow-Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. But to proceed: Secondly, The Father, by his Labour and Toil of his <hi>Body,</hi> or by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49679:140"/>that of his <hi>Brains,</hi> purchaſes to himſelf an Eſtate. His Son enjoys his Share in it while the Father lives, and the whole of it after his Death. How comes the Father's Purchaſe to derive to the Son? You will anſwer, By the Law. But the Queſtion returns; By what Act does the Law make the <hi>Father's</hi> Purchaſe to become the <hi>Son's?</hi> Why, it may be replied, that as the Son deſcended from the Father, ſo it is but fit that his Eſtate ſhould do ſo too. Well! be it ſo, or any thing elſe; (for more may be ſaid in the Caſe.) But ſtill in the Caſe, the Father's Right being extinct by his Death, moves, that is, is transferr'd upon another: So that he comes rightfully to <hi>poſſeſs</hi> the Eſtate, who yet did not <hi>purchaſe</hi> it, nor <hi>earn</hi> it, nor perhaps do any <hi>one Act</hi> for the obtaining the Poſſeſſion of it. Not only the <hi>Eſtate</hi> then, but the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to the Eſtate, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly lodged in the Purchaſe, and muſt be made good by it, is transferr'd from one Man to another, and that too not by or for any <hi>Action of Deſert</hi> in the Man who enters; but by an Act of <hi>Law,</hi> call it Imputation, Tranſlation, or what you pleaſe. And, which is more, ſuch a Tranſlation both of Eſtate and Title is accounted juſt by all Mankind, generally ſpeaking. For, it is not material in the Caſe, that ſome arbitrary and deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Governments do in ſome few Inſtances vary from it; becauſe not only the reſt of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49679:140"/>Mankind, but even they themſelves, do, by their <hi>contrary</hi> Practice in <hi>other</hi> and <hi>more</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>condemn</hi> their own Practice in <hi>this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to our Purpoſe: Shall the transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not only of one <hi>Man's Eſtate</hi> to another, but even of the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> in that Eſtate, be thought juſt between Men among themſelves, and that too by that Light of Reaſon, which is confeſſedly given them by God? And ſhall it at the ſame time be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and unjuſt for <hi>God</hi> ſo to make over his Purchaſe, his Right and Title to any Thing, (as he thinks fit) to Mankind, as one <hi>Man</hi> may do to <hi>another?</hi> Certainly he has as good a Right, and as full Power of diſpoſing of what is his own, as any Man, or any Law of Man whatſoever. And therefore, when he tells us, that he does ſo in the Caſe under our preſent Conſideration, it would become us in Modeſty, in Reaſon, and (becauſe the Caſe does very much import our Welfare) in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt likewiſe, to believe his Word, and to approve his Doings: And that too more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, becauſe in thoſe very Writings, in which the Conveyance is contained, he ſeems all along to word ſuch his Conveyance in <hi>Law-Terms;</hi> thereby giving us (at leaſt) an Hint, that in the Tranſaction of Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by our Saviour, he did in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure condeſcend to thoſe <hi>Methods</hi> and Ways of <hi>Judicial Proceedings,</hi> that <hi>Men,</hi> by that Light of Reaſon which they received from
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49679:141"/>him, had inſtituted among <hi>themſelves.</hi> And therefore, when we had forſaken his <hi>Family,</hi> by revolting from that Duty, which we owed him, as his <hi>Natural Children;</hi> as he calls himſelf our <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſo he calls us his <hi>Adopted</hi> Sons, upon his <hi>reſtoring</hi> us to ſuch his Family; and in order to the <hi>Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>loſt</hi> Title, he does eſteem us to be <hi>Regenerate,</hi> that ſo by becoming again the <hi>Children</hi> of God, we may <hi>inherit</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of him our <hi>Father.</hi> So he calls us the <hi>Heirs</hi> of Salvation, and makes us a <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of our Saviour, by calling us his <hi>Brethren.</hi> He reckons us as <hi>Joint-Heirs</hi> with him, and diſcourſes in ſeveral Places of our <hi>Inheritance.</hi> Now, when we are aſſured, by Multitudes of other Places of Scripture, that all theſe Appellations and Titles are given to us, not only in <hi>Terms</hi> in the like Caſes made uſe of, at that Time, by the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Laws,</hi> but alſo in Conſideration of our Saviour's <hi>Purchaſe;</hi> I ſay, when we find Things ſo, and that too in the Book of God, wrote profeſſedly on this Subject; does it become us to think, that the Holy Ghoſt, the Indicter of theſe Things, did only word himſelf at <hi>random?</hi> Or ought we not rather to think, that in ſo doing he had a <hi>Regard</hi> to thoſe <hi>Legal</hi> Ways of <hi>Conveyances,</hi> which were eſtabliſhed by Man's Reaſon and Senſe of Juſtice in thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> which were then moſt current in the World? We cannot, I am ſure,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49679:141"/>we cannot <hi>rationally</hi> think ſo. For, why are we told, that we are <hi>bought</hi> with a <hi>Price?</hi> Why are we told, that our Saviour <hi>purchaſed</hi> us with his Blood? Why are we told, that we are <hi>redeemed, not with corruptible Things, as Silver and Gold; but with the precious Blood of Chriſt;</hi> but that our Redemption and Salvation did, as to the Juſtice and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, anſwer to thoſe <hi>Legal</hi> Ways of transferring of Rights from Man to Man? For, our Redemption was <hi>purchaſed</hi> by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> (ſo it is expreſly worded) and by him therefore <hi>conveyed</hi> and <hi>made over</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe it could in no Senſe be called <hi>our</hi> Redemption. Indeed, a <hi>Purchaſe</hi> does, in the very import of the Word, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Acquiſition of a Thing in a <hi>Legal</hi> way; and by ſo doing, does, in the Nature of the Thing, imply alſo a <hi>Legal</hi> Power of <hi>making over</hi> ſuch Thing to <hi>another.</hi> For, he can only <hi>legally</hi> ſell, or otherwiſe give or convey, who has a <hi>Legal</hi> Right in the Thing ſold, given, or conveyed. And he can only <hi>legally</hi> purchaſe, who pays a <hi>Legal</hi> Price. When therefore the Holy Ghoſt in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures does ſo word the Manner of God's beſtowing and our receiving Salvation in and by our Saviour, as to do it in ſuch <hi>Terms,</hi> which were at that time Terms of the moſt <hi>celebrated</hi> Law (next to his own) that ever yet was, or perhaps ever will be in the World; and when he does ſo frequently, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49679:142"/>almoſt conſtantly; it would become us to believe and think, that he <hi>deſigned,</hi> and that too even by his <hi>manner</hi> of expreſſing the Thing, to inſinuate to us, that the Salvation he all along ſpeaks of, was beſtowed in a way of <hi>Conveyance</hi> at that time <hi>familiar</hi> among <hi>Mankind;</hi> in ſuch a way, as was eſtabliſhed both by their own <hi>Laws,</hi> and by their own <hi>Practice;</hi> in ſuch a way, that their beſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, granted to them by himſelf, had <hi>ſet on foot:</hi> And that, upon this Account, his way of doing it ſo, as is by him expreſſed, (and that too all along in that very Book, where he affords us the Diſcoveries of it) is juſt, equitable, and legal. I do but run over theſe Things, and in a manner glance at them; becauſe I rather deſign to give an Hint to <hi>others</hi> more able ſo to do, than to purſue them <hi>my ſelf.</hi> For, if a Man well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudied in the Civil Law (a Law that will weigh with Mankind ſo long as good and ſound Reaſon has a free Paſſage in the World:) But, I ſay, would ſuch a Man ſo throughly acquaint himſelf with the New-Covenant, the Covenant of Grace in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as to be able exactly to compare it with that Law, which is the Buſineſs of his Profeſſion; I do not at all queſtion, but that ſuch a Compariſon, judiciouſly managed, would go a great way in removing thoſe Doubts which have been ſtarted by People of all Parties, concerning Man's Redemption.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49679:142"/>And becauſe ſeveral Learned Men, I know, are very well verſed in <hi>both</hi> thoſe Laws; I do the rather hope, that God will put it into the Heart of ſome of them, to bleſs the World with ſuch a Chriſtian and beneficial Piece of Learning. But this by the by. In the mean time, from what has been ſaid in ſhort, we may learn thus much; That the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> is the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God; that the Benefit (at leaſt) of ſuch Purchaſe is by the Purchaſer <hi>made over</hi> to Man; that in Conſideration of that Intimate Union that is between him and Man, by his taking upon him the ſame Fleſh and Blood with Man, and by affording to Man the Communications of his Spirit, a Way is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as for the more congruous and equitable Way of ſuch <hi>Conveyanee,</hi> on the <hi>one</hi> Side; ſo, on the <hi>other</hi> Side, for the more congruous and equitable Way of Man's <hi>entring</hi> upon the Poſſeſſion of ſuch Purchaſe; and that when the whole Thing is ſtrictly ſifted and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it will be found to be agreeable to the juſt and equitable <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> as well as to the expreſs and plain <hi>Revelations</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> But I deſiſt: Only I would offer an Inference or two, that may relate to our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, before I do ſo.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, If God ſpared not his <hi>own Son,</hi> when he had put himſelf into the <hi>Place</hi> of Sinners; we may from thence conclude, that neither will he ſpare <hi>us,</hi> when we our ſelves
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49679:143"/>
                        <hi>are</hi> Sinners, and that too by our <hi>own</hi> default. For, beſides that he was, and was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by God himſelf, <hi>his only Son, in whom he was well pleaſed;</hi> I ſay, beſides that; the Generoſity, Charity, and Candor of ſuch an Undertaking as our Saviour's was, (by which he ſhewed more Tenderneſs to others, than to himſelf) may be thought to be a very conſiderable Motive even to Juſtice it ſelf, ſo far as is poſſible, to remit to him a great deal of that Rigour, and Severity, which Sin does deſerve. And then, if notwithſtanding ſuch his Undertaking, yet he was fain to pay the <hi>uttermoſt Farthing,</hi> that is, to die; how can we hope to eſcape, if we the Original, and therefore alſo the Principal Sinners, come under the Severity of ſo exact a Juſtice? We may be ſure, that the Portion of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance allotted to <hi>us</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, will not be leſs ſevere. For, if God ſo treated his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> becauſe <hi>interpoſing</hi> Son; how do we think he will treat <hi>avowed</hi> and <hi>profeſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels?</hi> Or, as our Saviour himſelf ſpeaks in the like Caſe, <hi>If theſe things are done in the</hi> green <hi>Tree, what ſhall be done in the</hi> dry?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as this Conſideration may ſerve us for <hi>Caution;</hi> ſo the next, that is, the ſecond, may ſerve us for <hi>Conſolation:</hi> And I ſhall give it in the Words of the Apoſtle, in the Eighth to the <hi>Romans, ver.</hi> 32. <hi>He, that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49679:143"/>give us all Things?</hi> For, his delivering up his Son for our ſakes to become <hi>Man,</hi> to lead an hard and uncomfortable <hi>Life,</hi> and to die a miſerable and ſcandalous <hi>Death,</hi> that both by his Life and Death he might work out our Salvation, is ſuch an exalted Evidence of God's Love to us, that Imagination it ſelf can hardly conceive, that any thing can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it, but our Ingratitude for it. And our Natural Reaſon and Common Senſe may eaſily inſtruct us, that he, whoſoever he be, that is ready and willing (and that too even to Performance) to do us the <hi>greateſt</hi> Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will not for that very Reaſon refuſe us in <hi>a leſs.</hi> It concerns us therefore, as we would not <hi>reject</hi> the Kindneſs <hi>already</hi> offered, and as we would not <hi>exclude</hi> our ſelves from all <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Love and Kindneſs, to make good our Gratitude, by receiving our Saviour, and that Salvation which he brings along with him, with a due Acknowledgment and Reſpect; and to make good ſuch our Reſpect, and ſuch our Acknowledgment, by receiving him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>any,</hi> but more eſpecially upon his <hi>own</hi> Terms. Let us therefore caſt away our <hi>Sins,</hi> that we may <hi>receive</hi> him: Let us, by <hi>loving</hi> each other, practice our ſelves to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>receive</hi> him: Let us receive <hi>him,</hi> by receiving the <hi>Pledges</hi> of his Love, exhibited to us in the Sacrament of his moſt Bleſſed Body and Blood: And let us not think, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified will profit us any thing, if we do <hi>not</hi>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:49679:144"/>ſo receive him, as he <hi>requires,</hi> and therefore alſo <hi>ſo</hi> receive him as we <hi>ought.</hi> For, he does in effect refuſe the <hi>Gift,</hi> who refuſes the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> of Conveyance by which ſuch Gift is to be <hi>ſigned</hi> and <hi>made over</hi> to him. And it is irrational and imprudent, to <hi>expect</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of him, the <hi>Pledges</hi> of whoſe Love we do <hi>reject.</hi> Let us caſt off therefore every evil Work, every Sin, that does beſet us, and <hi>gird up the Loins of our Mind,</hi> (as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks) and do the Work of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all Caſes whatſoever; that ſo at laſt we may receive the bleſſed Wages of ſuch Work, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>

                           <hi>That beſides the Saviour's Righteouſneſs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God will after their Reſurrection endow Believers with a perfect, inherent, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Holineſs. How the Saviour did fit and prepare Men for ſuch an Holineſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BY what has been hitherto diſcourſed, we have ſeen,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God in a Saviour has made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the <hi>Expiation</hi> of Man's Sin, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſave him from the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of the Law, the juſt <hi>Wages</hi> of ſuch Sin.</p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:49679:144"/>
                     <p n="2">2. We have ſeen, that he has not barely provided for Man's <hi>Eſcape</hi> from the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Law, by the Merits of his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Death; but that he has alſo provided for his poſitive and future <hi>Happineſs,</hi> by the Merit of his Saviour's Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But yet, in what is now to follow, we ſhall find, that his Mercy has not ſtopped here; becauſe, in the third place, he will, in and through our Saviour, endow Man with a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>inherent Holineſs:</hi> By which I mean, ſuch an holy, Angelical, and withal durable Frame of Spirit, that ſhall for ever ſecure him from all poſſible Sin, and ſhall for ever engage him in a vigorous and chearful Diſcharge of all holy Duties; and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall both <hi>accompany</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to all Eternity. For, tho' it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that Believers do by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Aſſiſtances of the Spirit arrive to a <hi>Degree</hi> of ſuch an Holineſs in this Life; yet it muſt be confeſſed alſo, that it is but an <hi>imperfect</hi> Degree: For, it is not vigorous, nor uniform, nor conſtant; but <hi>irreſolute</hi> and <hi>weak;</hi> and therefore has its frequent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Failings. But, as we ſhall ſee more fully in what is to follow, the Holineſs of the Saints in <hi>Glory</hi> is, like their Happineſs, <hi>firm, laſting,</hi> and <hi>immutable;</hi> and therefore will be found to be a Gift of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that does vaſtly, if not infinitely, exceed the moſt refined Holineſs of the very beſt Man
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49679:145"/>in this Vale of Sin and Miſery. It ſhall be the Buſineſs then of our preſent Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to make it good, that beſides that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which Believers in another World ſhall have to their <hi>Saviour's</hi> Righteouſneſs, in order to their <hi>future</hi> Happineſs, that they <hi>themſelves</hi> ſhall be endowed with a <hi>perfect, inherent,</hi> and <hi>indefectible</hi> Holineſs, in order to the <hi>ſecure Eternity</hi> of ſuch their Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Now, to put this Matter into a clear Light, that ſo we may be the more rationally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in all that is to follow; we lay it down, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God by his Almighty Power having made the World, and all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Beings in it, has by virtue of ſuch his Creation an undoubted Right and Title to the Dominion over all Things ſo by him cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: And that therefore all his Creatures ought to be in Subjection to him, and to act according to the Determinations of his Will. And it is hardly to be doubted, but that all thoſe Creatures, which by the Boundaries of their Creation are devoid of Underſtanding and Free-will, do conſtantly act (according to thoſe Impreſſes and Powers that God in their Formation has ſtamped upon them) in a regular Subordination to ſuch his Will. And the Scriptures do give us, not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Hints, but alſo expreſs Declarations, that ſo they do.</p>
                     <p>Now, as God created thoſe <hi>lower</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo did he the <hi>higher,</hi> and thoſe which
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49679:145"/>are endowed with more noble Faculties. And becauſe, among ſuch Creatures, upon whom he has beſtowed an <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> to enable them to <hi>know</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> and with a <hi>Will</hi> to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to chuſe <hi>Obedience</hi> to ſuch his Will, we are not acquainted with any <hi>other,</hi> but <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> and becauſe our Deſign is only concerned about <hi>them,</hi> and chiefly about the <hi>latter;</hi> therefore, directly to our preſent Purpoſe, we take notice,</p>
                     <p>That <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Angels, firſt;</hi> and, by their Inſtigation, the <hi>firſt Man;</hi> and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Men ever ſince do derive from him in a Lineal Propagation) therefore alſo <hi>all</hi> Mankind, by tranſgreſſing God's Will made known to them in his Laws, have revolted from their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him, and have, by ſo doing, in effect renounced and diſclaimed that their <hi>Subjection</hi> to his <hi>Dominion,</hi> which was (if I may ſo ſpeak) his natural and eſſential Right. For, Wickedneſs is a profeſſed and avowed <hi>Renunciation</hi> of that <hi>Subjection</hi> which Rational Creatures owe to their Holy and Rightful <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> even the God that made them. And, for that Reaſon, it is an <hi>Encroachment</hi> upon his <hi>Anthority;</hi> for it does leſſen and contract the Extent of his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> For, becauſe <hi>a Scepter of Righteouſneſs is the Scepter of his Kingdom;</hi> and becauſe all thoſe Laws, by which its Adminiſtration is execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are in themſelves Holy, Juſt, and Good; it is, upon that Account, very obvious to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49679:146"/>conceive, that Wickedneſs, ſo far as it goes, does defeat ſuch Adminiſtration, and overturn ſuch Laws; and by ſo doing, does <hi>diminiſh</hi> the <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>encroach</hi> upon the <hi>Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Rightful</hi> and <hi>Supreme Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, from what has been thus ſpoken in ſhort, we may eaſily underſtand, that the <hi>faln</hi> Angels having firſt revolted <hi>themſelves,</hi> and by their Sin withdrawn their Allegiance and Subjection to their moſt Holy and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord, did (what other Rebels after their <hi>Example,</hi> and perhaps by their <hi>Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> have done to weak and ſhort-ſighted People) by falſe Colours, and taking Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, invite <hi>Mankind</hi> into the ſame Revolt and Rebellion with themſelves; and, by ſo doing, draw away a Part of God's Kingdom and Dominion; and, in oppoſition to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that is, in oppoſition to God himſelf, ſet up a Kingdom of their <hi>own,</hi> a Kingdom of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs;</hi> in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a Kingdom made up of ſuch Creatures, who by their Sin and Wickedneſs did rebel againſt and revolt from their Holy and Rightful Lord and King. All this, being Matter of Fact, is expreſly diſcovered to us by the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God: And the Hiſtory of Man's Fall, recorded in his Word, with the Account that we there meet with of the Devils <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> of his <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> of his <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Captives,</hi> of his <hi>Wars</hi> againſt the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49679:146"/>Holy Angels, the faithful Subjects of the True and Everliving King, do afford us a very lively Deſcription of the Thing. And becauſe no <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who is but tolerably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Revelations of God in his Holy Word, can poſſibly be a Stranger to it; therefore we have thought it leſs neceſſary to quote the ſeveral Texts, which by being put regularly together, will give us an exact and Hiſtorical Account of it. And indeed, we have ſo much the leſs need to do ſo, becauſe we ſhall be farther and more fully ſatisfied in it by thoſe Things which are to follow. Well then! Things ſtanding in this State, God was pleaſed to ſend his Son, his Beloved Son, <hi>made of a Woman, made under the Law, made Man,</hi> to be a Saviour, a Redeemer, a Light to Mankind; that is, he ſent him in Man's Nature, to <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>direct,</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> and <hi>redeem</hi> Man from that Condition, into which he was brought by his Sin and <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi> What that Saviour did in order to the <hi>obtaining</hi> of ſuch Salvation, we have ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and what is to be done in order to the <hi>everlaſting</hi> Continuance of ſuch Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to be enquired now.</p>
                     <p>As therefore it was <hi>one</hi> Part of God's Counſel in ſending his Son to Mankind, to <hi>expiate</hi> their <hi>Sins;</hi> ſo it was <hi>another,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the main and grand Deſign of ſuch his Meſſage, to <hi>reſcue</hi> them from their <hi>Slavery</hi> to Sin, and from their <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Satan;</hi> and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49679:147"/>ſo to bring them back to his own <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and to reſettle them under the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of his own moſt holy <hi>Dominion.</hi> For, it is a very great Miſtake (which, I am apt to believe, has proceeded chiefly from our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſondneſs of our ſelves) to think, that God's <hi>chief</hi> Deſign in ſending our Saviour, was to free us from the <hi>Vengeance</hi> due to our Sins; thereby vainly imagining, that God has a greater Concern for our <hi>Impunity,</hi> than he has for our <hi>Holineſs;</hi> and that he had rather we ſhould be <hi>ſafe,</hi> than that we ſhould be <hi>good.</hi> Whereas our Reaſon will tell us, that God muſt needs love Holineſs, as he loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he himſelf is (if I may ſo ſpeak) Eſſential Holineſs: And then the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will tell us, that he muſt needs love <hi>himſelf</hi> better than he loves our <hi>Safety;</hi> and that more eſpecially, when we our ſelves, by ſlighting and neglecting of Holineſs, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed ſuch our Safety. As therefore Man did, by his Compliance with the Devil, that is, by his Sin, <hi>expoſe</hi> himſelf to the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of God's <hi>Vengeance;</hi> and as he did, by the ſame Means, ſo far forth <hi>revolt</hi> from his <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>withdraw</hi> himſelf from his <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> as to become the <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and <hi>Slave</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> (by which Means God was ouſted of his Natural and Original Right to Man's Obedience, and his Subjects ſo far forth drawn of from their Allegiance to him, as to ſlight his Authority, by ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49679:147"/>his Laws, and to fight againſt him, by oppoſing his Holineſs;) ſo, when the Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were come to this paſs, that <hi>Man</hi> did fight againſt <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>Sins,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> did fight againſt <hi>Man</hi> by his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> tho' God, in order to a Reconcilation, ſent his Son into the World, and by him a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pardon</hi> to all who ſhould <hi>return</hi> to their Duty; yet our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> nay, our <hi>Common Senſe</hi> will tell us, that the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of God's juſt Right and Dominion by Man's <hi>Return</hi> to <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> is in it ſelf a Point of <hi>greater</hi> moment, than <hi>Man's Pardon.</hi> And therefore, by the Tenor of that very Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in which the Articles of Reconciliation are contained, it is ſtipulated, that <hi>Man</hi> ſhall firſt be obliged to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>return,</hi> before <hi>God</hi> ſhall be obliged to <hi>forgive.</hi> And we know, that our Saviour himſelf, in that Prayer which he taught his Diſciples, and in them all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> does put that Petition, <hi>[Thy Kingdom come,]</hi> before that, by which we pray, that God would <hi>forgive our Treſpaſſes.</hi> Why, <hi>all the Nations of the Earth are before him, but as the Drop of the Bucket, or the ſmall Duſt of the Balance:</hi> And then, can we think, that his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Natural Right</hi> is not to be conſulted before Man's <hi>Safety?</hi> It cannot be; and becauſe it cannot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do conclude, that tho' God did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Man's Sin by a Saviour; yet for all that, the <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49679:148"/>of ſending him, who was to be that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, was the <hi>bringing</hi> Man from a State of Sin to a State of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> the <hi>purchaſing to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works;</hi> or, as it is in the Fifth to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch Thing;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reſtoring to God ſo much of that Part of his <hi>Dominion,</hi> which, by the Temptation of the Devil, and by Man's Revolt, had been <hi>broke</hi> off from his Kingdom, and which was <hi>willing,</hi> upon the Goſpel-Conditions, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of Pardon, to be <hi>reſtored</hi> again to it.</p>
                     <p>Now, from what has been ſpoken, I would infer, That it is a great Miſtake, to make the Sending of our Saviour in its <hi>firſt, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi> and <hi>grand</hi> Deſign, to be the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin. For, as <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Law is the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Deſign of the Law; and as Puniſhment is but a <hi>ſecondary</hi> Deſign of the Law, and is only grounded upon the Defeat of its grand and principal Deſign: So <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of Sin, in the very Nature of the Thing it ſelf, depending only upon the <hi>Deſert</hi> of Puniſhment, can therefore riſe no higher than its Fountain, and therefore can at the moſt be but a <hi>ſecondary</hi> Cauſe of our Saviour's Coming.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, ſhould we ſuppoſe God to <hi>pardon</hi> Sin, tho' in and through our Saviour, <hi>without</hi> any Regard had to the fulfilling of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49679:148"/>the <hi>Directive,</hi> that is, of the <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> Part of the Law; we ſhould, by that means, ſuppoſe him to <hi>break</hi> the <hi>Directive</hi> Part of the Law, in order to his <hi>contradicting</hi> the <hi>Vindictive</hi> Part; that is, we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to break <hi>both</hi> Parts of the Law, in order to ſuch a <hi>Pardon.</hi> For, Veracity is one Branch of Holineſs; and when God tells Man in his Law, that upon his Tranſgreſſion he ſhould <hi>ſurely</hi> die, as we may perceive by the <hi>manner</hi> of the Delivery, that the Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation is <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>ſolemn,</hi> not only becauſe it is backed with an <hi>Aſſeveration,</hi> but becauſe alſo it is <hi>incorporated</hi> into the <hi>Law;</hi> ſo, to tell us, that God may by a <hi>Pardon</hi> (that has <hi>no</hi> Regard to the <hi>Directive</hi> Part of the Law) <hi>revoke</hi> ſuch his ſolemn Threat and Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in effect to ſay, that he may <hi>ſtart</hi> from his <hi>Veracity;</hi> and that is the ſame as to ſay, he may ſtart from his <hi>Holineſs;</hi> or, in other Words, that he may <hi>himſelf</hi> break the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Part of the Law, by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> the Penalty of the <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>leſs</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. For, Holineſs is ſo refined a Thing, and ſo all of a Piece, (if I may ſo ſpeak) that he who tranſgreſſes its Rules in any <hi>one</hi> Caſe, does, by ſo doing, forfeit his Title to the <hi>whole,</hi> and therefore is truly called Unholy.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, I cannot but wonder, that Men, after almoſt Six thouſand Years Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the Caſe, in which, becauſe all Men have been <hi>Sinners,</hi> therefore all Men have
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49679:149"/>
                        <hi>died;</hi> I ſay, I cannot but wonder, that, after ſo long an Experience to the contrary, any Man ſhould now think, that Men may be freed from the Curſe of the Law, before they have fulfilled the Directions of it. For, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, by that Experience alone we may be inſtructed, that Men ſhould never be <hi>bleſſed</hi> with <hi>Impunity,</hi> till they <hi>firſt return</hi> to their <hi>Duty;</hi> and that they muſt <hi>firſt</hi> be <hi>obedient</hi> to the Law, before they ſhall be <hi>freed</hi> from the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe ſome Things under this Head may bear a Diſpute; and becauſe ſome others may ſeem hard to be underſtood; therefore, to be more plain and open, and to offer ſomething which is ſo, and which will as well conduce to my main Purpoſe and Deſign, I lay it down,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, That as it is aſſerted in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and is generally agreed among all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> That an Eternal Life and Happineſs is contained in that Salvation which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel promiſes; ſo is it, That whoſoever ſhall be made Partakers of ſuch Happineſs and ſuch Life, muſt be ſo perfectly Holy, as to be eternally free from all Sin. For, as <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> ſo, the Bleſſed in Glory are by all allowed, as to be eternally without <hi>Miſery,</hi> ſo to be eternally without <hi>Sin.</hi> And we do not queſtion, but that it may be made out, and that too by Force of Reaſon, without the Aſſiſtance of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49679:149"/>Revelation, that compleat Happineſs (and an Happineſs that is not eternal, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat) and that too in the Nature of the Thing, is inconſiſtent with Sin, which does certainly and conſtantly bring Miſery along with it, whereſoever it is permitted to come. And the Reaſon why I ſay, I do not queſtion it, is, becauſe what <hi>has</hi> Been done <hi>already, may</hi> be done <hi>again:</hi> And we know very well, that the Thing has been done already, and that too beyond all poſſible Contradiction. But becauſe it is an allowed Thing, That where the Seat of eternal Happineſs is, there nothing can either <hi>enter</hi> or <hi>remain</hi> but pure and unſpotted Holineſs; therefore we ſhall ſpend no Time in the Proof of it; but ſhall take it for granted, and ſo proceed to our</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Second Propoſition, which is, That the Holineſs of <hi>thoſe,</hi> who ſhall inherit eternal Life and Happineſs, does not come from <hi>themſelves,</hi> nor is either the Archievement or Fruit of their <hi>own</hi> Powers. This we may be ſure of, becauſe <hi>a clean Thing cannot come out of an unclean;</hi> and all Men here are unclean, becauſe all Men are Sinners. And ſince Man in his Innocence did not keep himſelf Holy, it is unreaſonable to expect, that after the Fall, when Mens Abilities are leſſened, that any Man ſhould make himſelf ſo. And we are moreover aſſured, that no Man does make himſelf ſo, becauſe all Men do die: And we are further aſſured, that no Man can <hi>carry</hi>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:49679:150"/>any more of his own Holineſs with him into <hi>another</hi> World, than what he was <hi>Owner</hi> of in <hi>this:</hi> And laſtly, we are infallibly aſſured, that no Man can ſecure to himſelf an Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Eternity,</hi> which he has <hi>not.</hi> From which Things run over in ſhort, we may be ſatisfied, that that Holineſs, which ſhall for ever attend thoſe of Mankind, who ſhall be made Partakers of eternal Happineſs, is not their <hi>own.</hi> The Thing might be made out in more Words; but it needs not: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since that Holineſs, with which Men ſhall be endowed in Heaven, is not their <hi>own;</hi> it muſt therefore be beſtowed upon them by ſome <hi>other:</hi> To which we may add, That that other can be no other, but <hi>God.</hi> For, it may be very well preſumed, that the very beſt of Creatures have no Holineſs to ſpare, upon a Suppoſition, that one Creature could make over any of his own Holineſs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, upon ſuch Suppoſition, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhould contribute towards the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi> of <hi>another</hi> Creatures Holineſs, would be ſo much <hi>pared off</hi> from their <hi>own;</hi> and ſo a <hi>Defect</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Holineſs would be the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of that <hi>other's</hi> Perfection; and an <hi>Abatement,</hi> at leaſt, if not the <hi>Loſs</hi> of their own <hi>Happineſs,</hi> a Conſequence of ſuch <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> But then it is a vain Thing to conceive, that <hi>one</hi> Creature can make over its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Holineſs to <hi>another;</hi> and it is as vain
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49679:150"/>a Thing to think, that it can beſtow on that other an Holineſs, which it has not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow; and it is certain, that it has no Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but its own. But neither ſhall I purſue this any farther, becauſe I ſhall at one View offer a ſhort Proſpect of all that has been already laid down, in order to make it good, That our Saviour has made Proviſion, that Believers ſhall be endowed with an indefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Holineſs in a future and happy Life.</p>
                     <p>Take we notice therefore, That as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Salvation does imply in it, not only the <hi>Pardon</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> but the <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> too; ſo the Reward of Righteouſneſs (as the Goſpel, and as he, who is both the Author of that <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and of that <hi>Reward,</hi> does ſet it forth) is to be eternal and everlaſting. Now, tho' it ſhould be granted, that <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> is in it ſelf the <hi>juſt</hi> Reward of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> yet it cannot be ſo freely granted, that an <hi>Eternity</hi> of Happineſs is ſo; unleſs that <hi>Duty,</hi> or <hi>Obedience,</hi> to which that Happineſs is aſſigned, be <hi>eternal</hi> alſo. And the Reaſon why ſuch a Thing cannot be granted, is grounded upon Matter of Fact, and that Matter of Fact authorized by God's own Judicial Proceedings. For, we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, that the faln Angels were once Holy; and we may affirm it ſo much the more ſafely, becauſe being in their Nature Creatures capable of ſo noble a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there can no doubt be made, but that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49679:151"/>they came forth ſuch out of the Hands of their moſt Holy Creator. Tho' therefore, while they <hi>remained</hi> Holy, that is, while they did their Duty, we do not queſtion their <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;</hi> yet we do maintain, that that <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> then <hi>ceaſed,</hi> when their <hi>Holineſs</hi> did ſo: And from thence we do conclude, that their <hi>Happineſs</hi> was therefore not eternal, becauſe their <hi>Holineſs</hi> was not ſo. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch their Holineſs, which was not eternal, was their <hi>Original,</hi> or their <hi>Natural,</hi> or their <hi>Perſonal</hi> Holineſs, (for you may call it which you pleaſe) therefore we do far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, that there is no Security, that any Creatures <hi>Perſonal</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> Holineſs ſhall be <hi>eternal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If therefore we ſhall bring our preſent Buſineſs to this Caſe, and by comparing one with the other, take leave to judge of what <hi>may</hi> be, by having ſeen what <hi>has</hi> been; we may take notice, that if our Saviour did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more for Man's Salvation, but only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge the Guilt of his Sins, and ſo reſtore him again to his <hi>Original</hi> Innocence; all this would warrant no more, than that Man ſhould by this Means have been reſtored to that Innocence, or Holineſs, of which <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood poſſeſſed before his Tranſgreſſion. But that this Holineſs ſhould be <hi>laſting</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> we have not all this while any the leaſt Ground of <hi>Warrant,</hi> no nor of <hi>Conjecture:</hi> Nav, we may rather conclude, that it would
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49679:151"/>
                        <hi>not</hi> be ſo; becauſe we know, to our Coſt, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s was not ſo. For, I would ask, Whether this Innocence, or Holineſs, be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make Man happy? If it be both anſwered, and granted, That it is; then I would further demand, Whether it will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that Happineſs to Eternity? If it will, then it muſt be ſomething more than a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of Man to a State of an <hi>Adamical</hi> Holineſs; for we are ſure, that that firſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs could do no ſuch thing: If it will not, then it will not anſwer to a Goſpel-Salvation, becauſe ſuch a Salvation does imply in it everlaſting Happineſs, and everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs muſt (as we have ſeen) be attended with everlaſting Holineſs. In one Word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if, as Man's <hi>Happineſs</hi> does depend upon his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> ſo his <hi>everlaſting</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt depend upon his <hi>everlaſting</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; then we may well reckon, that that Holineſs of Man, which ſhall accompany <hi>eternal</hi> Salvation, muſt be an <hi>indefectible</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that ſhall never fail, and therefore whoſe Reward ſhall never ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>And by this time, we hope, that the Truth of what we have laid down, and of what we deſigned to make good, may begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; which is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Chief Deſign of our Saviour's coming into the World, was to bring ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man to a State of perfect Holineſs; for, by that Man's chief Happineſs, and (which
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49679:152"/>is yet a great deal more) God's original Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Juriſdiction over Man, is provided for.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That an everlaſting Holineſs is required to an everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That ſuch an Holineſs is none of Man's own, and that therefore,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It muſt come from ſome other; and that that other muſt be God.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore ſeen, by what has been ſaid, that an everlaſting Holineſs is neceſſary, in order to Man's everlaſting Salvation, and that ſuch Holineſs muſt come from God: Let us proceed, and by that Light, which his Revelations have afforded us in this Caſe, enquire, what <hi>Proviſion</hi> God has made for the furniſhing Man with ſuch an Holineſs, in order to ſuch his Salvation. And,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We are inſtructed by ſuch Revelations, That God ſent his Son, our Saviour, into the World, cloathed with the ſame Fleſh with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man, to inſtruct and direct him in the Ways of Holineſs, by his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and by his <hi>Example:</hi> That upon this Account he is called <hi>the Light of the World;</hi> for he made our Duty plain and intelligible, took off that Veil from Mens Underſtandings, by which they were induced to believe, that Holineſs did conſiſt in outward Waſhings, in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Formalities, and ſuch other or Modes or Geſtures, which contained nothing of true Holineſs in them, becauſe they did
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49679:152"/>not form our Spirits to God's Likeneſs, nor make us <hi>holy, as he is holy.</hi> And becauſe he found Men laden with Sin, he did adviſe them to unburden themſelves by Repentance, that ſo they might the more expeditely ſet about the Attainment of that Holineſs, which he recommended to their Practice. And hence it was, that his Fore-runner, <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> firſt, and <hi>he</hi> himſelf, and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> afterwards, did all begin their great Work with an Exhortation therefore to <hi>Repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand.</hi> In a Word, in order to terrifie Men from their wicked Courſes, and to invite them into the Paths of true Piety and Godlineſs, he did by his <hi>Threats</hi> acquaint them with a more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, grievous,</hi> and <hi>future Puniſhment;</hi> and by his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> with a more <hi>expreſs, happy,</hi> and <hi>future Reward,</hi> than either Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Revelation had as yet diſcovered. Theſe, with ſome other, were the Methods which our Saviour, when in the Fleſh, took to perſuade Men to add their <hi>own</hi> Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to <hi>his,</hi> for their obtaining Salvation. And becauſe theſe Things were <hi>deſigned</hi> for ſuch a Purpoſe by him, and becauſe they have in themſelves a natural <hi>tendency</hi> to bring ſuch Deſign to paſs; and becauſe, laſtly, the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> does in the whole Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of it proceed from the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> therefore theſe Things, when ſummed up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under one Denomination, are called
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49679:153"/>
                        <hi>Means of Grace.</hi> Theſe therefore, and the like Means of Grace, and them too backed and confirmed by Miracles, our Saviour made uſe of, to engage Men to practiſe and attain that Holineſs, by which alone they could in Juſtice be fitted for Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But then, ſecondly, we are inſtructed, both by God's Word, and by our own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, That all theſe Means made uſe of by our Saviour, did never yet produce <hi>that</hi> Holineſs in any Man, which is to <hi>fit</hi> him for his deſigned <hi>Salvation.</hi> For, what from <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> and <hi>Irreſolutions</hi> from <hi>within,</hi> and what from <hi>Temptations</hi> from <hi>without;</hi> what from the Temptations of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and what from his <hi>own</hi> wicked, habitual, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Practices, every Man falls ſhort of the Grace of God; and his very beſt Practices being corrupted with Careleſneſs, or Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, or Wilfulneſs, (and all of them Evil) do not beget in him that Holineſs, to which alone eternal Salvation can in Juſtice belong. It may be then demanded, How any Man comes to be ſaved? To which I anſwer in the next, that is, the</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Third place, That tho' the Means of Grace do not <hi>beget</hi> that Holineſs in any Man in this Life, in Conſideration of which he can in Juſtice obtain eternal Salvation; yet we are aſſured, that the Means of Grace ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the Goſpel, and made uſe of by Man, may, and often have this Effect, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49679:153"/>Men heartily to <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>wiſh</hi> for ſuch an Holineſs. This is what our Saviour calls <hi>hungring and thirſting after Righteouſneſs:</hi> An hearty and ſincere <hi>Deſire</hi> to <hi>be</hi> what we <hi>ought</hi> to be; and (to make good the Sincerity of ſuch our Deſire) an hearty and ſincere En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be what we <hi>deſire</hi> to be. For, no Man does or can heartily and ſincerely <hi>deſire</hi> any Thing, who does not alſo heartily <hi>endeavour</hi> to obtain it. Now, an hearty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and an hearty Endeavour after Holineſs, does (if I may ſo ſpeak) open and enlarge the Soul to admit and receive ſuch Holineſs, whenever God ſhall be pleaſed to beſtow it. And becauſe <hi>every good and perfect Gift comes from above, from the Father of Light,</hi> we may be therefore ſure, that <hi>Holineſs,</hi> the beſt and moſt perfect Gift, whereof we are capable, does ſo too. And we are moreover ſure in Reaſon, that God will more <hi>freely beſtow</hi> his beſt Gift there, where it is moſt <hi>heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,</hi> and therefore alſo moſt <hi>kindly received:</hi> And we are the more ſure, that he will do ſo in the preſent Caſe, becauſe the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> muſt in this Caſe <hi>concur</hi> with the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> or elſe it is impoſſible, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to be beſtowed ſhould ever become his own. For, no Man can in Reaſon or Nature be holy againſt his own <hi>Will.</hi> He then, who by the Means of Grace has advanced ſo far as to hunger and thirſt after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall be ſure to be filled. We have his
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49679:154"/>Promiſe for it, who is <hi>able</hi> to make it <hi>good;</hi> and we have his Promiſe for it, whoſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> cannot <hi>fail.</hi> And then we cannot but be ſenſible, that he who is <hi>filled</hi> with Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, cannot want that Holineſs which accompanies Salvation. And truly, when I conſider, how theſe <hi>lower</hi> good Things, the Bleſſings of Nature, which are confeſſedly the Bounties of the God of Nature, do freely flow in upon all his Creatures, where their natural Appetites or Wants do deſire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them, and (where their Powers and Faculties are ſuch) in purſuit of ſuch their Deſires, they endeavour to obtain them; it mightily inclines me to think, that his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Holineſs</hi> will alſo there flow in, where the <hi>moral</hi> Appetites of his Rational Creatures do ſincerely deſire it; and where they are ſo ſenſible of their Want of it, as to <hi>endeavour</hi> after it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We proceed, and add, in the fourth place, That we are inſtructed, both by God's Word, and by our own Experience, that tho' a perfect Holineſs may be heartily <hi>deſired,</hi> and ſincerely <hi>endeavoured</hi> after; yet, that it is never attained by any Man in <hi>this</hi> Life; and therefore ſo neither is a perfect <hi>Happineſs.</hi> The Evidence for the <hi>firſt</hi> is, becauſe all Men in this World are <hi>Sinners;</hi> and the Evidence for the <hi>laſt</hi> is, becauſe all Men in this World are <hi>Mortal.</hi> Now, as <hi>Sin</hi> is an infallible Confutation of a perfect <hi>Holineſs;</hi> ſo <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:49679:154"/>is an infallible Confutation of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Happineſs.</hi> We are therefore at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived thus far, that no Man ſhall arrive at a perfect Holineſs, till he is tranſlated to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> World: And becauſe it is difficult, if not impoſſible, to conceive, how any Man ſhould arrive at a perfect Holineſs in the <hi>Grave;</hi> therefore we may go one Step farther, and add, that no Man ſhall attain to ſuch an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, till the <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> And we may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fairly and rationally <hi>conjecture,</hi> (I may ſay, <hi>infer</hi>) That then the <hi>Faithful ſhall:</hi> For, we know, that by the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> we ſhall be releaſed from the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law on the <hi>one</hi> Hand, and ſhall enter upon the <hi>Reward</hi> of Obedience and Holineſs on the <hi>other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. And then, laſtly, Becauſe that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which our Saviour has purchaſed for Believers, is an <hi>eternal</hi> Happineſs; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as we have ſeen) it is impoſſible, that there ſhould be any ſuch Thing as an eternal <hi>Happineſs,</hi> without an eternal <hi>Holineſs;</hi> and becauſe to pretend to beſtow an everlaſting <hi>Happineſs</hi> upon Man, and not an everlaſting <hi>Holineſs,</hi> without which ſuch an Happineſs is <hi>impoſſible,</hi> is to <hi>mock</hi> Man, and not to <hi>ſave</hi> him; and becauſe, laſtly, we cannot without Blaſphemy and Abſurdity tax the Counſels and Purpoſes of our Saviour, in the Buſineſs of Man's Salvation, of ſuch groſs Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: therefore we do at laſt conclude,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49679:155"/>That <hi>God</hi> in our <hi>Saviour</hi> will endow Believers, at or upon their Reſurrection, with an <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, Immutable,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Holineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now we have obſerved before, That the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> threatned by the Goſpel againſt thoſe, who ſhall <hi>refuſe</hi> their Salvation by the Neglect of the Conditions of the Goſpel, is <hi>greater</hi> than what was threatned againſt the Breach of the Law of <hi>Works,</hi> the Law given to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that the <hi>Reward</hi> propoſed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to thoſe, who ſhall <hi>admit</hi> the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, is <hi>greater</hi> than what was by the Law propoſed to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And we have obſerved in this Chapter, That that <hi>Inherent</hi> and <hi>Indefectible</hi> Holineſs, which is a Part of ſuch Reward, is greater and nobler than <hi>Adam</hi>'s Holineſs before the Fall; becauſe it is more laſting than that of him, or indeed of the faln Angels.</p>
                     <p>Now it is certain, that the Degrees of the <hi>Puniſhments</hi> are by Juſtice proportioned to the Degrees of the ſeveral Sinners own <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</hi> And it is certain, that the Rewards of <hi>eternal</hi> Life, and of an <hi>Indefectible Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> do in Juſtice exceed the Deſerts of <hi>all</hi> that are ſaved, (for they have been all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.) And then, what Grounds theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations may afford for the magnifying of God's Grace, and the Merits and Dignity of our Saviour's Purchaſe and Perſon, may be a Matter worthy our Meditations. But I
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49679:155"/>ſhall not purſue it here, becauſe tho' there be an Occaſion for me to enlarge what has been ſaid already; yet I am unwilling to repeat.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. By what <hi>Way</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> they ſhall be put into the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of ſuch Eternal Life? And,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. And in order to the Reſolution of the firſt Thing, we lay it down, as a certain Truth, in the firſt place, That Man, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his <hi>entring</hi> upon the Poſſeſſion of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Life,</hi> muſt firſt <hi>riſe</hi> from the Dead. For,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49679:156"/>all Men die, becauſe all Men are Sinners: And becauſe it is abſurd ſo much as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that Man can enter upon the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of Eternal <hi>Life,</hi> while he <hi>remains</hi> under the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Death;</hi> therefore, without any more ado, we ſhall take it for granted, that Man muſt be freed from that <hi>Death,</hi> which is <hi>brought</hi> upon him by his <hi>Sin,</hi> before he can obtain that Eternal <hi>Life,</hi> which is <hi>purchaſed</hi> for him by his <hi>Saviour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We lay it down, in the ſecond place, as a certain Truth, That becauſe our Saviour underwent Death <hi>himſelf</hi> for the Expiation of Man's Sin; and becauſe our Saviour could not in Nature or Poſſibility be <hi>qualified</hi> to <hi>beſtow</hi> upon Man the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of ſuch his Death, till he himſelf ſhould <hi>riſe</hi> from the Dead: That therefore, in order to Man's entring upon the Poſſeſſion of an Eternal Life, it was neceſſary, that our Saviour <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> as well as Man, ſhould firſt <hi>riſe</hi> from the Dead.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We lay it down, in the Third place, That if the Merits of our Saviour's Death were of Value <hi>ſufficient</hi> to make good the <hi>Expiation</hi> of Man's Sin; that then, in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> he ought to <hi>riſe</hi> again from the Dead. For, becauſe, in the Caſe ſo put, he could have no Concern with Juſtice, but what was his <hi>own;</hi> and becauſe he himſelf had paid an <hi>exact</hi> Obedience to the Law; and becauſe <hi>Life</hi> is the Reward of ſuch <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:49679:156"/>as <hi>Death</hi> is the Wages of <hi>Diſobedience;</hi> Therefore, if we do allow him to have <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded</hi> himſelf of the Sin of <hi>Man,</hi> which he had taken upon himſelf, by his <hi>Death;</hi> we muſt, and do, by ſo doing, <hi>reinſtate</hi> him in his <hi>own Right;</hi> that is, we muſt allow, that he had a <hi>Right</hi> to be, and therefore in Juſtice <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>reſtored</hi> to Life again. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not at all to be queſtioned, but that our Saviour had never died at <hi>all,</hi> if he had never taken upon himſelf the Sins of other <hi>Men.</hi> But of this more by and by. In the mean while, theſe Things being laid down, we proceed, and,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Obſerve in the firſt place, That our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Reſurrection is almoſt conſtantly by the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God the <hi>Father:</hi> And Multitudes of Texts might be quoted for it; as, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the <hi>Acts, ver.</hi> 24, <hi>&amp;</hi> 30. The Fifth Chapter of the ſame, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, <hi>&amp;</hi> 30. The Tenth, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. The Seventeenth, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. The Tenth to the <hi>Romans, ver.</hi> 9. The Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We know well enough, that they, who make it their Buſineſs to <hi>degrade</hi> our Saviour below his moſt exalted Dignity and Station, do make uſe of theſe Texts for <hi>ſuch</hi> their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: But we know withal, that there are other Texts, tho' indeed not ſo many; and ſome of them, when compared with their Context, not ſo Categorical; which yet
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49679:157"/>aſcribe his Reſurrection to <hi>himſelf.</hi> Such is that in the Second Chapter of St. <hi>John, v.</hi> 19. <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three Days I will raiſe it up.</hi> And ſo again, in the Tenth of St. <hi>John, v.</hi> 18. <hi>No Man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to</hi> take <hi>it again.</hi> Now, as we made it out juſt now, that after the Expiation finiſhed he had a Right to <hi>riſe</hi> from the Dead; ſo we do not at all queſtion, but that he had a Power to raiſe <hi>himſelf</hi> too. But tho' it ſhould be <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,</hi> (as we do not at all queſtion, and that too from ſeveral Things already laid down, and made good, but that it may be <hi>proved:</hi>) But, I ſay, tho' it ſhould be <hi>allowed,</hi> that he had both a <hi>Right</hi> and a <hi>Power</hi> to raiſe <hi>himſelf</hi> from the Dead; yet notwithſtanding that, it was not altogether ſo congruous or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the equitable Proceedings of Juſtice, that he ſhould <hi>exerciſe</hi> ſuch his Power, or put <hi>himſelf</hi> into the poſſeſſion of ſuch his Right, in the <hi>preſent</hi> Caſe. For, becauſe he had <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to offer his Life an Expiatory Sacrifice to the Divine Juſtice, for the Sin of Man; he had by ſuch his Submiſſion ſo far <hi>reſigned</hi> ſuch his Right and Power into the Hand of <hi>God,</hi> as that, both by the Laws of Reaſon and Juſtice, as well as by the Rules of Decency and Congruity, <hi>God</hi> was now become the <hi>ſole Judge</hi> of the Validity of ſuch his Sacrifice, for the Accompliſhment of the deſigned Expiation. And if God was the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49679:157"/>ſole <hi>Judge</hi> of the Validity of his Sacrifice; he had by the ſame Means the rightful (and I may add, the ſole) <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>declaring</hi> ſuch Validity: And becauſe the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Saviour from the Dead, was in effect ſuch a <hi>Declaration;</hi> therefore we may now be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, why the Holy Ghoſt does ſo very <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> and in a manner <hi>conſtantly,</hi> aſcribe the Reſurrection of our Saviour in the Scriptures, to God <hi>alone.</hi> To which we may add, That the High-Prieſt under the Law (who in this very Caſe was a Type of our Saviour) was obliged <hi>once a Year to enter into the Holy of Holies, but</hi> (as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> words it) <hi>not without Blood, which he offered for himſelf, and for the Errors of the People.</hi> In which Caſe, it muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>offering</hi> of the Blood to God was in order to his <hi>acceptance;</hi> and that God's <hi>acceptance</hi> of the Blood, that is, of the Life of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was the <hi>Ratification</hi> of that Expiation, that was made by ſuch Sacrifice. And in deed and truth, our Saviour in the Buſineſs now before us, being both the Prieſt and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God for the Sins of Man; and his Reſurrection being the firſt Teſtimony or Declaration of the Acceptance of ſuch his Sacrifice: We cannot in any Congruity ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſuch Teſtimony or Declaration ſhould be aſcribed to any <hi>other,</hi> but to <hi>God</hi> alone. And therefore, as all thoſe Texts, which aſcribe our Saviour's Reſurrection to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49679:158"/>
                        <hi>God,</hi> do in this Caſe ſpeak <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly;</hi> ſo we may now, by what has been ſaid, perceive, that they are no <hi>Prejudice</hi> to his <hi>Divinity;</hi> becauſe he having obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>offer</hi> that Body, to which his Deity was united, a Sacrifice for Sin; he had by the ſame Act obliged himſelf to <hi>expect</hi> from <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Approbation</hi> and <hi>Allowance</hi> of ſuch his Sacrifice; and therefore alſo to receive from <hi>him</hi> his Reſurrection, which was an effectual Declaration of ſuch Allowance: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I do offer it to Conſideration, That the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> from the Dead, was an undoubted Argument, that he had <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> and compleated that Expiation, which he had undertaken to make by his Death for the Sins of Men. For, as we are aſſured by the Scriptures, that he was <hi>crucified, dead, and buried;</hi> and ſo, that he died the Death of a <hi>Criminal:</hi> So we are aſſured by the ſame Scriptures, that he did not die for his <hi>own</hi> Crimes. For, it is utterly impoſſible, and that too in the Nature of the Thing, that he ſhould <hi>die</hi> for his own Sins, who yet <hi>did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth;</hi> that is, who had <hi>no</hi> Sins of his own to die for. Now, becauſe we are taught by the Scriptures, and (as we have already made it out) becauſe our Reaſon, guided by them, does fall in with them, and ſo both do tell us, that <hi>the Wages of</hi> Sin <hi>is Death;</hi> that is,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49679:158"/>that there is a Natural Juſtice in the Caſe, that Death ſhould be inflicted as the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin: And becauſe we are aſſured by the ſame Natural Reaſon, that it muſt needs be unjuſt to inflict the ſame Puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Innocent Perſon, which is the juſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a Criminal: I ſay, for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we may be ſatisfied, that our Saviour, tho' he was in himſelf <hi>a Lamb without Spot,</hi> yet did die for <hi>ſome Sins</hi> or others, (be thoſe Sins whoſe they will at preſent:) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe the Spirit of God has by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Word told us, that he died for <hi>our</hi> Sins; we may, upon his Teſtimony, reſt ſatisfied, that <hi>ſo</hi> he did. Thus far therefore we have advanced towards our preſent Purpoſe and Argument; That Death was what the Law threatned for our Sins, and that we being Sinners, and ſo having incurred the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance threatned, our Saviour (who, as we have ſhewed, had an abſolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Power to diſpoſe of his own Life, as he himſelf pleaſed) did put himſelf in our ſtead, became a Sacrifice for us, and ſo in his own <hi>Perſon</hi> ſuffered that Death, which <hi>we</hi> by <hi>our</hi> Sins had deſerved. But then, to the making good of our preſent Propoſition, we add, That as he ſuffered <hi>Death</hi> for the <hi>Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of our Sins; ſo if he had not <hi>finiſhed</hi> and <hi>compleated</hi> ſuch Expiation, he had not <hi>roſe</hi> again. For, ſo long as the <hi>Guilt remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſo long the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> was, and that too
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49679:159"/>in Juſtice, to be <hi>continued.</hi> For, in ſuch Caſe, there had been the ſame Reaſon for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation</hi> of the Puniſhment, that there was for its firſt <hi>Infliction.</hi> And therefore, as it was firſt <hi>inflicted</hi> for a <hi>Guilt,</hi> ſo it muſt have been <hi>continued</hi> for the <hi>Continuation</hi> of ſuch Guilt. From which we do infer, That if he was juſtly acquitted from the <hi>Continuation</hi> of the Puniſhment, then he was alſo acquitted from the <hi>Guilt;</hi> and if he was juſtly acquitted from the <hi>Guilt,</hi> that then he had by his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment made a <hi>ſufficient Expiation</hi> for it. And that he was acquitted from the <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> due to the Guilt, and that he was <hi>juſtly</hi> acquitted too, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> ſingly and by it ſelf will make out an undoubted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable <hi>Argument.</hi> For, our natural and common Senſe does aſſure us, that a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to Life is an Acquittance and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from Death: And Reaſon will tell us, that becauſe a Diſcharge from Death can only come from <hi>God,</hi> and becauſe God cannot but be <hi>juſt;</hi> therefore that Acquittance and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, that is made by a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> muſt needs be juſt too. And therefore, from the Whole we may infer, That the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Saviour from that Death, which he ſuffered as the Puniſhment of our Sins, was a demonſtrative Argument and Proof, that by his Death he had paid a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Ranſom, and had made a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Expiation for ſuch Sins. So that, ſtrictly ſpeaking, in his <hi>Death</hi>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:49679:159"/>conſiſted the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of our Sins; in the <hi>Infinite Value</hi> of his Death conſiſted the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> of our Sins; and in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> appears the full <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of ſuch his Expiation.</p>
                     <p>Before we part with this Head, it may not be improper to take notice, that becauſe his Death was of <hi>infinite</hi> Value, that therefore there was a ſufficient Ranſom paid for our Sins by that Death, ſo <hi>ſoon</hi> as it was ſuffered. For, it muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>Ranſom</hi> was then <hi>made,</hi> when the <hi>Debt</hi> was <hi>paid.</hi> And becauſe that is Truth and Juſtice, we do from thence infer, That our Saviour might, and that juſtly too, have reſumed his Life ſo ſoon as he had laid it down. And ſo he might (for any thing that Juſtice can offer to the contrary) have deſcended <hi>alive</hi> from the Croſs, after he had once <hi>died</hi> upon it: Nor needed his Reſurrection, in point of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to have been deferred to the <hi>third</hi> Day, but might (had God ſo pleaſed) have been cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the <hi>firſt.</hi> But tho' it might <hi>juſtly</hi> have been done ſo; yet we do not find, that it was <hi>actually</hi> ſo done; for the Scriptures tell us, that he did not riſe till the third Day. From whence we obſerve, That as he <hi>died</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> Man from Sin; ſo he did for ſome time <hi>continue</hi> in a State of Death, to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> and <hi>aſſure</hi> us, that he did ſo die. And ſo as his <hi>Death</hi> had a regard to God's <hi>Juſtice;</hi> ſo his <hi>Continuance</hi> ſo long under the Power of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49679:160"/>Death had a regard to our <hi>Faith.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> was the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of our Salvation: The <hi>laſt</hi> was our <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of, and therefore alſo our <hi>Comfort</hi> in ſuch a Purchaſe. By which we may underſtand, that his Love was expreſſed to us even in the Grave; and tho' (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>no</hi> Man <hi>remembreth</hi> God <hi>in the Pit;</hi> yet we may hence learn, that even in the Pit our <hi>God</hi> both <hi>can,</hi> and <hi>has</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred <hi>us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may alſo under this Head take notice, That as our Saviour had <hi>never</hi> died at <hi>all</hi> (as we obſerved before) becauſe he himſelf was perfectly <hi>Innocent,</hi> if he had not by his <hi>own Choice</hi> put himſelf in the ſtead, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to the Puniſhment of the <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> ſo we may be confident, that he, whoſe Innocence was ſo ſingular and illuſtrious, as not to be in the leaſt tarniſhed, whilſt he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited</hi> in mortal Fleſh and Blood, muſt, now that Fleſh and Blood is <hi>ſpiritualized,</hi> (ſee the Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 44.) be rather the <hi>more</hi> free (if that were poſſible) from all <hi>poſſibility</hi> of Stain or Guilt. And we may be ſecure, that if his glorified Body ſhall ever live free from <hi>Sin,</hi> it ſhall for that ſingle Reaſon, if yet there were no other, live free from <hi>Death</hi> too. So true is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in the Sixth to the <hi>Romans, ver.</hi> 9. that <hi>Chriſt being raiſed from the Dead, dieth no more, Death hath no more Dominion over him:</hi> and that in the <hi>Revelations, I am he, that was
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49679:160"/>dead, and am alive, and live for evermore.</hi> So that the Victory which our Saviour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over Death, by his Reſurrection, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo well be looked upon as a <hi>ſingle</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſince it is to extend it ſelf to all <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions</hi> of Ages and Time; and is to <hi>laſt,</hi> when Time ſhall be <hi>no more;</hi> that is, for <hi>ever and ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. As our Saviour, by his Reſurrection, did ſo far ſubdue Death, as to obtain to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> a future and ſecure Immortality; ſo alſo he did, by the ſame Reſurrection, ſo far ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Death, as to ſecure a future and glorious Reſurrection to all <hi>thoſe,</hi> who are ſo far <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the likeneſs of his Death,</hi> as to be <hi>dead</hi> to <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>alive</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> For, if we live to him, while we live here; we may, from his Reſurrection, have a comfortable Aſſurance, that notwithſtanding we die for a time, as he did; yet we ſhall be raiſed again, and live with him for evermore. To this purpoſe, we muſt recollect, that when he died, he did not die for his <hi>own</hi> Sins, but for <hi>ours.</hi> And then, if in his <hi>Death</hi> he laid down his Life in <hi>our</hi> ſtead; we may be eaſily ſatisfied, that it was in <hi>our</hi> ſtead that he <hi>took it up</hi> again at his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> For, if our Guilt had not been cancelled, and ſo our Debt diſcharged, by his Death; then his Death (as we obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the laſt Head) had been continued ſtill. And as <hi>then</hi> we did conclude, that he had therefore <hi>ſatisfied</hi> the Debt, becauſe he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49679:161"/>was <hi>releaſed</hi> from the Penalty; ſo <hi>now</hi> we do conclude, that becauſe the Debt ſo diſcharged was <hi>ours,</hi> and not his <hi>own;</hi> therefore the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Releaſe muſt redound to <hi>us,</hi> as well as to <hi>him.</hi> For, it muſt needs be unjuſt in the Creditor to detain us in Priſon for that Debt, which our Surety has paid. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know, that the Creditor in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe is God himſelf; and becauſe we know alſo, that ſuch a Creditor can do no Injuſtice; therefore we know, that as when our Saviour <hi>laid down</hi> his Life, he laid it down in <hi>our</hi> ſtead; ſo alſo, that when he <hi>took</hi> it up again, he took up with it the Lives of all <hi>thoſe,</hi> who by the Conditions of the New Covenant ſhall have an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in ſuch his Death. And therefore, as our Chriſtianity does acquaint us, that they who live to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> do live by the Spirit; ſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to our preſent purpoſe, does tell us, in the Eighth to the <hi>Romans, ver.</hi> 11. that <hi>if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, do dwell in you; he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal Bodies, by his Spirit, that dwelleth in you.</hi> In a Word, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our Head, and we are his Members; and becauſe he, and we, do make up one Body; and becauſe, as Members of ſuch his Body, we are quickned by his Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may confirm our <hi>own</hi> Reſurrection by <hi>his.</hi> And therefore, as he is called <hi>the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born from the Dead,</hi> in the Firſt to the <hi>Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:49679:161"/>ver.</hi> 18. ſo we are called <hi>the Children of the Reſurrection,</hi> in the Twentieth of St. <hi>Luke, ver.</hi> 36. So that a good Man, from the Certainty of his <hi>Saviour's</hi> Reſurrection from Death to Glory and Immortality, may ſafely conclude his <hi>own;</hi> may lie down in his <hi>Grave</hi> as ſecurely, as in his <hi>Bed;</hi> and when the Morning of the Great Day ſhall down forth, may be <hi>more</hi> ſecure of riſing again, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his <hi>Body;</hi> than he can be, that he ſhall riſe on the <hi>Morrow-morning,</hi> and put on his <hi>Clothes:</hi> For, for the <hi>firſt</hi> he has the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Omnipotence;</hi> but for the <hi>laſt</hi> he has only the Promiſes of his own <hi>Preſumption,</hi> or (at the very beſt) but of his <hi>Hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. As the Faithful ſhall, in Conſideration of our Saviour's Death and Reſurrection, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own Reſurrection from <hi>Death</hi> to <hi>Life;</hi> ſo the Life, which by ſuch their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection they ſhall obtain, ſhall be Life <hi>Eternal.</hi> This is expreſs Scripture; and a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may therefore be ſatisfied in, and aſſured of its Truth. For, our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf tells us as much, when giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Laſt Judgment, he cloſes ſuch Account, in the Laſt Verſe of the Twenty fifth Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> with theſe Words; <hi>[And theſe ſhall go into everlaſting Puniſhment:]</hi> and then follows that, which is directly to our preſent Purpoſe, [<hi>But the Righteous into Life</hi> Eternal.]</p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:49679:162"/>
                     <p>And Reaſon tells us, that ſo it muſt needs be; becauſe where the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all Death whatſoever is taken away, there the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of Death muſt be taken away too; unleſs we ſhould imagine, that Death ſhould be brought upon a Rational Creature, ſubject to Law, without any meritorious Cauſe of Death at all. But (as we have often laid it down, and proved it already) that cannot be ſuppoſed in the preſent Caſe; becauſe the Death, we now ſpeak of, is ſuppoſed to come from <hi>God's</hi> Juſtice; and the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God cannot either truly, or rationally be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to inflict Death <hi>there, where</hi> there is no Deſert of it. Now, we therefore know, that the meritorious Cauſe of Death is Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know, that <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> If therefore, as we have already ſeen, the Sin of the Faithful be <hi>taken away</hi> by the <hi>Expiation,</hi> and if upon their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection they obtain an <hi>indefectible</hi> Holineſs; the Inference will be, That the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Death, Sin, will upon the <hi>firſt</hi> Account be <hi>cancelled,</hi> and <hi>blotted</hi> out; and that, upon the <hi>laſt</hi> Account, it cannot be <hi>renewed</hi> or <hi>reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi> and that therefore, upon <hi>both</hi> Accounts in conjunction, Death, the Wages of Sin, can never more <hi>return.</hi> And then, when a Life reſtored is ſecured from all poſſible return of Death, we may be ſure, that ſuch Life ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored muſt be Eternal. And agreeable to what we now ſay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, in the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49679:162"/>Third to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the laſt Verſe, that our Saviour, whom we look for from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>ſhall change our vile Body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mighty working, whereby he is able even to ſubdue all Things unto himſelf.</hi> Now we know, that when our Saviour appeared to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, to that very Apoſtle who tells us theſe Things, he does expreſly affirm to King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> in the Twenty ſixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that <hi>the Light of the Appearance was above the Brightneſs of the Sun,</hi> (and yet the Context will tell us, that the Appearance was made <hi>about Mid-day.</hi>) And perhaps our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Transfiguration on the Mount was a Proleptick Diſcovery of that Glory, with which his Body was to be cloathed upon his Aſcent into Heaven, the Mount of God. But be that as it will; yet to our Purpoſe: If the Bodies of the Saints ſhall be <hi>faſhioned like unto</hi> his <hi>glorious Body,</hi> then it will be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Concluſion, That they ſhall with that Glory put on an <hi>Immortal</hi> Frame and Conſtitution. And this Concluſion will then advance from Probable to Certain, when we know, that the ſame Apoſtle does acquaint us, not only, that our Body, <hi>which is ſown in diſhonour, ſhall be raiſed in glory;</hi> but, over and above, that <hi>this</hi> Corruptible <hi>muſt put on</hi> Incorruption, and that <hi>this</hi> Mortal <hi>muſt put on</hi> Immortality. Much more might be offered on this Subject; but, from what has been
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49679:163"/>glanced at, we may now perceive, that our Body, in imitation of our Saviour's Body, ſhall after its Reſurrection be indued with a glorious Frame, and an immortal Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that it ſhall be done by his <hi>Power,</hi> as it ſhall in Conſideration of his <hi>Merit;</hi> that the Power that ſhall do it, is <hi>able to ſubdue all Things to it ſelf,</hi> that is, is Omnipotent. And then, where we have the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to us an Eternal Life; there we can have no Reaſon to <hi>doubt</hi> the Eternity of ſuch Life.</p>
                     <p>The Second Thing ſhould now in Order follow, which is to ſhew, wherein the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſuch Eternal Life does conſiſt. But before we ſpeak to that, I ſhall lay down two or three Practical Conſiderations; which, as they look <hi>back</hi> to what has been ſpoken <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,</hi> ſo will be no improper <hi>Introduction</hi> to thoſe Things which are to <hi>follow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, We ſhould be ſenſible of, and grateful for that bleſſed Proviſion, that our Lord and Saviour has made for our Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs and Security. And this we ſhould ſo much the rather be, becauſe, by what has been ſaid, we may now underſtand, that ſuch Proviſion does fully anſwer to our higheſt natural Deſires and Inclinations. For, our Anxiety for our own Welfare will tell us, that among all the ſeveral Appetites, by which we purſue after our own Happineſs,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49679:163"/>our Deſire of <hi>Life</hi> does hold the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> Place with us. And the Reaſon is plain, becauſe the Loſs of <hi>Life</hi> muſt needs be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Loſs of all <hi>other</hi> Enjoyments whatſoever, that can in any wiſe conduce to our Happineſs. And, as we are told by our Common Senſe, that our grand and topping <hi>Appetite</hi> is that of <hi>Life;</hi> ſo we are told by the ſame Common Senſe, that <hi>Immortality</hi> is a ſure <hi>Fence</hi> for that Life. If therefore God has graciouſly made Proviſion for the Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this our moſt exalted Appetite, by ſecuring to us a future Immortality; and if, over and above, he has engaged to ſecure that very Immortality from the Loads and Incumbrances of all thoſe Miſeries, which do conſtantly attend our Mortal Life in this World: I ſay, if God has done ſo great Things for us, we ought to look upon our ſelves to be obliged in Gratitude to endeavour a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn (as far as our ſlender Abilities go) in ſome meaſure proportionate to the Almighty Bounty. For, if ever our Thanks be due to any one whomſoever; then moſt certainly they muſt be ſo to him, who is willing, and able, and has promiſed to gratifie the <hi>utmoſt</hi> Pitch, and the moſt <hi>exalted</hi> Deſires of our own Self-love.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Has God provided an Immortal and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Life for us in <hi>another</hi> World? Then that ſhould engage us not to ſet up for Happineſs in <hi>this.</hi> For, tho' it be granted, that the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49679:164"/>Good Things of <hi>this</hi> Life are <hi>preſent,</hi> and <hi>at hand;</hi> but that thoſe of a <hi>better</hi> Life are lodged at a <hi>diſtance;</hi> and ſo we are engaged in our Purſuit after the <hi>firſt</hi> by our <hi>Senſes,</hi> but we can only purſue the <hi>laſt</hi> by our <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Hope:</hi> Yet, becauſe our Experience, upon innumerable Repetitions, has conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us, that our <hi>Senſes</hi> have alway <hi>decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> us, (for, our higheſt and moſt exalted Enjoyments here do always determine in Emptineſs and Diſſatisfaction:) I ſay, for this ſingle Reaſon, (if yet there were no other) we ſhould for the future rather ſeek for the Happineſs we deſire there, where our <hi>Faith</hi> tells us, it may be <hi>had;</hi> than to repeat our Diſappointments, by purſuing it there, where our <hi>Experience</hi> has convinced us, that it <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> Alas! a very little conſideration may ſatisfie us, that in our Attempts after Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by the Purſuit of the Good Things of <hi>this</hi> Life, we always blunder; and that too, whether we <hi>do,</hi> or do <hi>not</hi> obtain thoſe Good Things, which we ſo purſue. For, if we do <hi>not,</hi> then we loſe our deſired Happineſs by our <hi>Diſappointment:</hi> But if we <hi>do,</hi> then either <hi>they</hi> muſt <hi>leave us,</hi> by reaſon of their <hi>ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſs</hi> and <hi>uncertainty;</hi> or <hi>we</hi> muſt leave <hi>them,</hi> by reaſon of our <hi>Mortality.</hi> And then, be it <hi>one,</hi> or be it <hi>t'other,</hi> the Caſe is much one and the ſame; for, in both Caſes, the expected Happineſs vaniſhes. And becauſe by this we may perceive, that we cannot be
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:49679:164"/>made happy by any Thing in <hi>this</hi> Life; therefore,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let us be exhorted to ſeek our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a <hi>future</hi> Life; that is, (as has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to ſeek it there, where it may be <hi>had.</hi> For, if Happineſs be to be had any where, undoubtedly it is to be had in the Favour and Preſence of God; who, as he is the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author of all <hi>Things,</hi> ſo for that Reaſon alone he is the undoubted Author of all that <hi>Happineſs,</hi> which we can poſſibly reap from the Enjoyment of any Good whatſoever. Now, becauſe the ſame Revelations, which have diſcovered to us a Future and Immortal Life, have alſo acquainted us, that that Life is lodged in the kind and favourable Preſence of God, that is, in Heaven; and becauſe we know, that no unholy or impure Thing ſhall come into the Preſence of him, who <hi>is of purer Eyes, than to behold Iniquity:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the preſent <hi>Exhortation,</hi> let me add this <hi>Direction,</hi> and that is, That we purſue our future <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> (or <hi>Eternal Life hereafter</hi>) by an <hi>holy</hi> Life <hi>here.</hi> For, the true and ſolid Reaſon, why there is no <hi>Miſery</hi> nor <hi>Death</hi> in Heaven, is becauſe there is no <hi>Sin</hi> nor <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> there. For, Death and Miſery are ſo far forth the inſeparable Companions of Sin and Wickedneſs, that, as where-ever we find the <hi>laſt,</hi> there we are ſure to find the <hi>firſt;</hi> ſo, where the <hi>firſt</hi> are not, there we may be ſure, that the <hi>laſt</hi> are ſhut
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49679:165"/>out. And therefore, becauſe <hi>Mortality</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> have no Place in Heaven, we may, for that Reaſon, ſtand confirmed, that <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Impiety</hi> have no Place there neither. If therefore we do in good earneſt deſign to be lodged in thoſe Regions of Happineſs, we muſt firſt be ſure to caſt off our Sins, and to leave them behind us. For, ſo ſure as Death is the Wages of Sin, ſo ſure it is, that Immortality and Happineſs ſhall not be the Portion of the Impenitent. And ſo long as God is in his own Nature Holy, and that is, ſo long as he is God, ſo long he muſt be diſpleaſed with all thoſe, who are pleaſed with, and make much of Sin, the grand Enemy of ſuch his Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the grand Enemy of ſuch his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving in the laſt Chapter ſhewed, by what Means we are put into the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an Happy and Eternal Life, the Purchaſe of our Saviour's Merits: We muſt in this, according to our Promiſe, inquire wherein the Happineſs of ſuch Life does conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>And, in anſwer to this Inquiry, we lay it down, in ſhort; That the Conſummate Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Saints in Eternal Life, does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in that Joy, Pleaſure, and full Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which reſults from their <hi>Loving the Lord their God with all their Heart, with all their Soul, with all their Strength, and with all their Mind;</hi> and from their Enjoyment of God (the Party beloved) and his Love. I have choſe to expreſs the Love of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints to God, in the Words of Scripture, becauſe they ſeem to me to contain in them ſuch an Intenſe Love, under ſo large and comprehenſive an Expreſſion, that, had I delivered it in other Words, I ſhould more than have doubted, that I ſhould have fallen
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49679:166"/>ſhort of the Thing. And I do believe, that ſuch Caution will then appear to be no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Nicety, when we ſhall come ſeriouſly to weigh and conſider thoſe Things that follow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, we take notice, what every one may eaſily be ſatisfied of by their own Experience, That we love <hi>our ſelves</hi> beſt, that is, before and beyond all other Perſons, and all Things whatſoever. And there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor can be any doubt, but that ſuch our Inclination is planted in us at our firſt Formation, by the Hand of God himſelf. And therefore neither does God ever require of us to ſlight or caſt it away, but by ſuch Motives, that will more than recompenſe all the Evil, that we do, or can ſuffer, by our ſo doing. And therefore he, who in the Cauſe of God and Goodneſs ſhall ſo far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue his own Welfare, as to part with that Welfare (be it what it will) for the ſake of ſuch Cauſe, may be ſure of a Compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God's Hand, that ſhall repair his Damages with advantage, and that too, tho' what he ſo parts with be Life it ſelf. And therefore it was a fixed and undoubted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion in the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuffered Martyrdom for his Saviour's, and Religions ſake, was certainly thereupon crowned with Glory; and with them, to be a Martyr, and to be crowned, were equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Expreſſions; for, they meant the ſame
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:49679:166"/>Thing, whether they made uſe of the one or of the other. So confident were they of the Truth of their Saviour's Promiſe, in the Nineteenth of St. <hi>Matthew, ver.</hi> 29. <hi>Every one that hath forſaken Houſes, or Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, for my Names ſake, ſhall receive an hundred-fold, and ſhall inherit ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life:</hi> and of that in the Tenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Evangeliſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. <hi>He that loſeth his Life for my ſake, ſhall find it.</hi> By which we may underſtand, that God does ſo far allow our Self-love, the Work of his own Hand, that where, for his ſake, we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>lay</hi> it aſide in <hi>leſſer</hi> Matters, there he has, in requital for our ſo doing, obliged himſelf to provide for the <hi>gratification</hi> of it in <hi>greater</hi> Matters.</p>
                     <p>Now, tho' it be confeſſed, that there is a Thing too frequently, and too kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among Mankind, which wears the Name of Self-love; and which is not only commonly accounted, but which alſo really is in it ſelf <hi>Criminal:</hi> Yet, if we narrowly look into ſuch Crime, we ſhall find, that it is not <hi>therefore</hi> a Crime, becauſe it is <hi>Self-love,</hi> but becauſe it <hi>excludes</hi> our Love of <hi>others.</hi> It is indeed kind to <hi>it ſelf,</hi> (as all Self-love, and that too in the Nature of the Thing, muſt needs be) but then it is kind to <hi>very few</hi> or <hi>none</hi> beſides. And therefore the Viciouſneſs of it conſiſts, not ſo much in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:49679:167"/>
                        <hi>doing</hi> what it <hi>does,</hi> as in <hi>not</hi> doing what it <hi>ought</hi> to do: That is, the Self-love, ſo far as it is only Self-love, is innocent: But it then becomes a Sin, when it advances to Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs. For, every Man is allowed (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in a degree required) to love himſelf; but no Man is allowed, no not upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſuch his Love, to hate another. Nay, he may love himſelf beſt; but by ſo doing, he muſt not ſhut out all others from any <hi>Share</hi> in his Love; nor (where his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Condition, meaſured by the Standard of Common Humanity, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity, will allow him ſo to do) muſt he ſhut out others from the <hi>Proofs</hi> and <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> that he allows them ſuch a Share. So that as we are ſatisfied by our own Senſe of the Thing, (and that is as great a Satisfaction, as we are capable of in any Caſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever) that we <hi>love</hi> our ſelves beſt; ſo, by what has been ſaid, it may now appear, that we do not <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> any Duty of Morality or Religion by our ſo doing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Our next Propoſition muſt be, That as we love our ſelves beſt, ſo our <hi>Love</hi> of any Perſon or Thing <hi>beſides</hi> is <hi>directed</hi> by and to our <hi>Self-love.</hi> For, we therefore love any <hi>Thing,</hi> becauſe it does, or at leaſt becauſe we think it may conduce to our <hi>own</hi> Welfare and Happineſs. For, all Love has in it a Mixture of Deſire; and then, as the Love of our ſelves is accompanied with a Deſire
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:49679:167"/>of our own Welfare; ſo, becauſe we love our ſelves <hi>beſt,</hi> all our other Deſires muſt, for that Reaſon, be in a <hi>ſubordination</hi> to that. And therefore, tho' our Love to other Men may engage us to do very great and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Kindneſſes to <hi>ſuch</hi> Men; yet, for all that, we ſhould not do ſo, did we not, by ſo doing, gratifie <hi>our ſelves.</hi> For, tho' it is confeſſed, that becauſe our Kindneſſes to them proceeded from our Love to them, that therefore we deſign to pleaſe and gratifie them by our Kindneſſes; yet it is full as true, that if <hi>their</hi> Pleaſure and Gratification were not pleaſant and grateful to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> we ſhould leave thoſe Kindneſſes undone, by which we deſigned ſuch their Pleaſure and Gratification. And as it is thus notorious, that our Love to <hi>other Perſons</hi> is finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into the Love of <hi>our ſelves;</hi> ſo it is <hi>as,</hi> if not <hi>more</hi> notorious, that our Love of <hi>Things</hi> is ſo. For, Things have no Senſe of our Kindneſs to them; and therefore our Kindneſs to them, were it for their ſakes, would be irrational and abſurd; for there could no Account be given of it in Reaſon, or Nature. But becauſe we our ſelves are capable of <hi>receiving</hi> a Benefit from Things, by our having a Senſe of ſuch Benefit; and becauſe we are capable of <hi>apprehending</hi> ſuch our Benefit, <hi>before</hi> we do <hi>obtain</hi> them, as well as <hi>when</hi> we do <hi>poſſeſs</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> them; therefore we may from thence be ſatisfied,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49679:168"/>that our Love, and therefore alſo our Deſire of them, does ſpring from ſuch our Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of our <hi>own</hi> Benefit; and we may be ſure, that the Deſire of ſuch our own Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit does come from our Self-love. So that now we may be as well convinced, that our Love to <hi>other Perſons,</hi> or to <hi>Things,</hi> does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from our <hi>Self-love,</hi> under <hi>this</hi> Head; as under the <hi>laſt</hi> we might, that we love <hi>our ſelves</hi> beſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let our Third Propoſition then be this: That we find in our ſelves, and that too by our own Senſe (I may ſay, Feeling) of the Thing, ſuch a <hi>Want</hi> of that, that will ſatisfie the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of our Self-love, that we are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch our Self-love, (that is, we are conſtrained by Nature; for Self-love, as we have ſeen, is natural;) I ſay, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Nature to ſeek for a Supply for ſuch our Want from <hi>abroad;</hi> that is, we are conſtrained to ſeek for it <hi>out</hi> of our ſelves. This might be abundantly proved from the great Variety of theſe our Wants, which can only be relieved by a <hi>Foreign</hi> Supply; and thoſe too, Wants, not only of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> but of our <hi>Minds;</hi> without our obtaining of which, we do account our ſelves in a degree <hi>miſerable;</hi> at leaſt, not <hi>ſo</hi> happy, as to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our <hi>Self-love.</hi> But the Thing being Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and our Conviction of its Truth being ſo too, it needs not. And therefore I would have it here remarked, that my chief Aim in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:49679:168"/>laying down this Propoſition, is to adjuſt the Coherence, and by conſequence the Proof of my main Deſign, which is to ſhew, wherein our Grand and Eternal Happineſs does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
                     <p>But yet (becauſe it may in ſome meaſure conduce to ſuch our Deſign) we ſhall, before we quit this Propoſition, leave this Remark upon it: That it is not <hi>unlikely,</hi> if it be not <hi>certain,</hi> that God in our very Formation has ſo ordered our natural Frame and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as the Deſires of our <hi>Self-love</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be anſwered nor ſupplied by our <hi>Self-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency;</hi> ſo, that ſuch our Deſires ſhould carry our Thoughts abroad to ſeek ſuch Supply <hi>elſewhere.</hi> Which is (if I may ſo ſpeak) the firſt Step, to which we are obliged by Nature, in order to our ſeeking after <hi>God.</hi> And in the next place, That God has made all Things in this World, within the compaſs of our poſſible Purchaſe, ſo inadequate to the Deſires of our Self-love, that when we do actually obtain ſuch Things, our higheſt and moſt exalted Enjoyment of them does ſtill <hi>fall ſhort</hi> and does never <hi>fill</hi> or <hi>ſatisfie</hi> ſuch our Deſires. Which is the Second Natural Step to bring us to <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Remark then being left by the way; let our Fourth Propoſition be this: That the <hi>more</hi> we <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>believe,</hi> that other Perſons or Things will anſwer to, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Deſires of our Self-love; the <hi>greater</hi>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:49679:169"/>Value <hi>we put</hi> upon them; and the <hi>greater Value</hi> we put upon them, the <hi>more</hi> we love them. The Truth of which Propoſition is as certain, as it is certain, that we deſire to gratifie our Self-love: And it is as certain, that we deſire to gratifie our Self-love, as it is certain, that we have ſuch a Thing in us as Self-love. For, becauſe our Self-love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a Deſire of our own Gratification; and becauſe a Deſire of our own Gratification contains in it a Love of thoſe Perſons or Things, from which we expect to receive ſuch Gratification: I ſay, for theſe Reaſons, to ſuppoſe, that we ſhall not love ſuch Things or Perſons in proportion to that Gratification, which we expect to receive from them, is to ſuppoſe us to contradict thoſe very Deſires, which yet at the ſame time we do profeſſedly entertain. We ſhall therefore take our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Propoſition for good and true, and that is, That we muſt needs love all Perſons and Things according as we think or know, that they will anſwer to, or gratifie the Deſires of our Self-love.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The natural and immediate Effect of our Love of any Perſon or Thing, is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>poſſeſſing</hi> or <hi>enjoying</hi> the Perſon or Thing ſo loved. For, our <hi>Deſire</hi> of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Thing includes in it our preſent <hi>Want</hi> of ſuch Thing or Perſon. Now, if ſuch our Want were not at home, that is, in our ſelves, we need not ſeek abroad, or out of our ſelves,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49679:169"/>for a Supply of it. And becauſe the Want, which in the preſent Caſe we feel in our ſelves, is <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>immovable,</hi> and ſo cannot ſtir abroad; therefore that, that muſt ſupply ſuch Want, muſt be <hi>brought home</hi> to it. Our Supply then muſt be cauſed by the <hi>Union</hi> of that Thing or Perſon to our ſelves, which is to ſupply ſuch Want. And when that Thing or Perſon is united to our ſelves, then, and not before, we may be ſaid to poſſeſs or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſuch Thing or Perſon.</p>
                     <p>I do believe, that the Truth of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may be doubted; becauſe we may be ſatisfied with the Aſſurance of our Friend's <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> tho' we do not enjoy his <hi>Company.</hi> And ſomething very like it may be ſaid of the Satisfaction that we take in ſeveral Things, tho' at a diſtance from us. But when it is conſidered, that tho' we do not enjoy the <hi>Company</hi> of our abſent Friend, yet for all that, we do at that very time enjoy his <hi>Friendſhip;</hi> and that tho' his <hi>Perſon</hi> be <hi>abſent</hi> from us, yet that the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is <hi>preſent</hi> with us, and <hi>lodged</hi> in our <hi>Breaſts;</hi> we may then begin to be ſatisfied, that ſo far forth as our Deſires are gratified, or our Want ſupplied, ſo far forth that, which does ſo gratifie or ſupply them, is <hi>preſent</hi> with us, which is an <hi>aſſured Satisfaction</hi> of our Friend's Love and Kindneſs to us. But then we muſt take notice, that if our Deſires do extend themſelves farther; as ſuppoſe, if
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49679:170"/>our Love of him engages us to deſire the <hi>Preſence</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> as earneſtly as the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance</hi> of his <hi>Friendſhip;</hi> then, in ſuch a Caſe, as our Deſires and our Want are more than barely the Deſire and Want of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Kindneſs; ſo ſuch our greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Want cannot be ſupplied, but by the Preſence and Enjoyment of his Perſon and Company. And therefore, ſtrictly ſpeaking, our Deſire of his <hi>Company</hi> proceeds from our Love of his <hi>Perſon;</hi> but our Deſire of his <hi>Friendſhip</hi> proceeds from our Love of ſuch <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> which is a <hi>Thing,</hi> and not a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> But then it muſt be granted, that no Man can love another, but that, according to the Degree of ſuch his Love, he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his Company too; and that the want of his Company would be attended with an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction proportionate to the Degrees of his Love; if the <hi>Abſence</hi> of his <hi>Perſon</hi> were not in ſome meaſure compenſated by the <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of his <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> which is <hi>preſent.</hi> And what is thus true of Perſons, is ſo alſo of Things. For, we therefore <hi>deſire</hi> any Thing, becauſe we <hi>love</hi> it, and becauſe we <hi>want</hi> it: And then the only way to ſupply ſuch Want, and to gratifie ſuch our Love, is, by bringing ſuch Thing <hi>home</hi> into our own Poſſeſſion, that is, within the <hi>reach</hi> of our <hi>Enjoyment.</hi> For, an hungry Man may as ſoon fill his Belly with the Meat that remains in the Market, while he tarries at home, as any Man's Love
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49679:170"/>of any Thing or Perſon can be gratified, while that Perſon or Thing is out of the reach of his Poſſeſſion or Enjoyment. For, as it is abſurd to imagine, that any Man can love any Perſon or Thing, without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to poſſeſs or enjoy them; ſo it is equally abſurd to think, that he can poſſeſs or enjoy them, while they are at a diſtance from him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Five Propoſitions I have laid down, as previous and introductory to the making out the Truth, which we now purſue; and that is, That the Happineſs of our Eternal Life will conſiſt in that Pleaſure and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which we ſhall take in our Love and Enjoyment of God, and in his Love of us. For, it is obvious, becauſe natural, for us to conceive, that all poſſible Happineſs (be that Happineſs what it will) muſt come from ſomething that is grateful to our Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is, from ſomething which we love; and therefore alſo from ſomething, which (if we want it) we do alſo deſire: That what we ſo want and deſire, cannot make us happy, till we poſſeſs and enjoy it; becauſe till then our Deſires are not fulfilled: That our Make and Frame is ſuch, that we feel in our ſelves that we do want That, that muſt make us happy; and that therefore, if we will obtain it, we muſt ſeek for it abroad, and out of our ſelves: And laſtly, That our Self-love does, and that too neceſſarily, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to ſeek after ſuch Thing: I ſay, theſe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49679:171"/>are natural and eaſie Truths, and (as we ſhall perceive preſently) ſuch, as will lead us into the Diſcovery of what at preſent we do only enquire after, <hi>viz.</hi> The Nature of our Eternal Happineſs; or, Wherein our Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>And that we may from Enquiry advance to Diſcovery, I would offer it to Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the firſt place.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That when our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhall be refined, by the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Glorification</hi> of the <hi>laſt,</hi> and by the <hi>compleat Holineſs</hi> of the <hi>firſt;</hi> that then we ſhall have ſuch a true Senſe of the great and ſupereminent Value of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> that we ſhall upon that Account love that <hi>above</hi> and <hi>beyond</hi> all Things <hi>beſides.</hi> For then we ſhall perceive and know, that God <hi>therefore</hi> makes us <hi>holy,</hi> that <hi>ſo</hi> he may make us <hi>happy:</hi> That our <hi>Happineſs begins,</hi> when our <hi>Holineſs does;</hi> and that it is then <hi>perfected,</hi> when our Holineſs <hi>is ſo:</hi> That Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is the Perfection of <hi>God's</hi> Nature, and of <hi>our own:</hi> That where Holineſs is in its moſt exalted Excellence and Perfection, it is the ſame Thing with Wiſdom and Truth, with Omniſcience and Omnipotence; and that it is the true and only Fountain of all real and rational Happineſs. And then, that which is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of our <hi>own Happineſs,</hi> muſt, when once it appears ſo to us, be the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>greateſt Love,</hi> as ſure as it is, that we do love our ſelves beſt.</p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:49679:171"/>
                     <p n="2">2. Where we find ſuch Holineſs (which we ſhall be better acquainted with by our Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and compleat Sanctification) in its <hi>greateſt</hi> and moſt <hi>exalted Perfection</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence;</hi> there our Love of ſuch Holineſs muſt in Nature and Reaſon, (and our Reaſon will then be exactly refined and diſcerning;) I ſay, that where we find Holineſs in its <hi>greateſt</hi> and moſt <hi>exalted Perfection</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,</hi> there our <hi>greateſt</hi> and moſt <hi>intenſe Love</hi> of Holineſs will be lodged. For, when we come to love Holineſs for its own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and Perfection; then we ſhall be ſure to love that Holineſs <hi>moſt,</hi> which has the greateſt and moſt <hi>exalted</hi> Excellence and Perfection.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This our greateſt and moſt intenſe Love of the greateſt and moſt perfect Holineſs, will (as we may rationally conceive) be ſtill augmented and increaſed, when we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it as lodged in an Intelligent Being. For, our Love (and that too in Nature) to <hi>ſuch</hi> a Being, is <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> greater than our Love of <hi>Things;</hi> becauſe <hi>ſuch</hi> a Being is (if I may ſo ſpeak) more congenerous and cognate to us, than <hi>Things</hi> are; and we find the <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Sympathy</hi> to be in Nature always <hi>greater</hi> there, where there is the <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cognation.</hi> The further Uſe which we make of this Propoſition, beſides that already laid down, is to unite our Love of <hi>God</hi> and our Love of <hi>Holineſs</hi> together, and ſo to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49679:172"/>exhibit them under one View; as indeed in God they are but one and the ſame Thing. And therefore, in what follows, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Phraſe; and what hitherto we have called our Love of Holineſs, muſt hereafter be ſtyled our Love of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our Love of our moſt Holy God will ſtill receive a conſiderable Addition of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, when we ſhall come to know, that his <hi>Holineſs</hi> is not only moſt <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted;</hi> but that it is alſo accompanied with all other <hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Perfections,</hi> and that too in the higheſt and moſt perfect Degree. For, tho' God be One with his Holineſs, and all other his Attributes; yet it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at leaſt, whether the Capacities even of glorified Creatures ſhall ever be ſo enlarged, as to apprehend his Beauties and Excellencies any otherwiſe, than by diſtinct and ſeparate Conceptions: Nay, it may be more than doubted, whether thoſe their Conceptions ſhall be adequate to thoſe his (to them) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Beauties and Excellencies, which ſhall be the Objects of ſuch their Conceptions. For, it is hard to conceive, that the glorified Capacities of Creatures ſhall be made Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite by their Glorification; and unleſs they be ſo, we are ſure, that the moſt Seraphick Conceptions muſt needs fall ſhort of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Object. And we know, that it is ſufficient for any Creature to have its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-capacities (when moſt enlarged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined)
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49679:172"/>filled and ſatiated by Happineſs. For, no Creature is <hi>capable</hi> of, and no Creature can <hi>deſire</hi> more, than a full and compleat Happineſs: And that Happineſs is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly full and compleat, which is as much as he can contain.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Increaſe of our Love to our moſt Holy God will ſtill grow <hi>greater</hi> by our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that he loves <hi>us again.</hi> For, it is a Truth in Nature, That, as Love ſlighted or refuſed does by that Means grow cold, and ſo in time languiſhes and expires; ſo, if it be kindly received, and anſwered by Love again, it therefore grows the warmer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then its Hopes begin to turn into Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. And, as Love for Love between <hi>Mankind</hi> carries in it <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Requital;</hi> ſo the Love of <hi>God</hi> for the Love of <hi>Man</hi> carries in it <hi>Recompence</hi> and <hi>Reward:</hi> And in <hi>both</hi> Caſes it increaſes the <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi> And then certainly it muſt be Infinite Happineſs to be bleſſed with the Love of him, who is Infinitely Happy in <hi>himſelf,</hi> and the undoubted <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of all poſſible Happineſs to all <hi>others.</hi> For, all Love <hi>wiſhes</hi> well to the Party beloved at <hi>leaſt;</hi> and where its Power anſwers to its Wiſhes, <hi>does</hi> well too. And then, when once we are in poſſeſſion of <hi>God's Love,</hi> we are therefore ſecure of our <hi>own Happineſs,</hi> becauſe we are ſecure, that all poſſible Happineſs is within the Reach of his Power. And indeed, to ſuppoſe the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:49679:173"/>Saints love of God, and by conſequence their <hi>Holineſs</hi> to <hi>be</hi> perfect, and to ſuppoſe their <hi>Happineſs not</hi> to be ſo, would be in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſuppoſe the <hi>Creature,</hi> in its Love to <hi>God,</hi> to outdo <hi>God</hi> in his Love to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> No! Perfect Holineſs, where-ever it is, is a Ray of his leading and moſt beloved Attribute: And we can in Reaſon no more conceive, that God will not love ſuch an <hi>Holineſs,</hi> than we can conceive, that he does not love <hi>himſelf.</hi> And then we may be ſure, that the Happineſs of the Creature will in the final Iſſue (and of that only we ſpeak at preſent) bear a Proportion to its Holineſs.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Increaſe of our Love to God will ſtill grow greater and greater, when we come to find, as moſt certainly we ſhall ſo find it, that his Love of us will engage him to <hi>unite</hi> us more intimately to <hi>himſelf.</hi> The Union of the glorified Saints with God, is, it muſt be confeſſed, a great Myſtery; for ſo that muſt needs be, which <hi>neither Eye hath ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter into Man's</hi> Heart <hi>to</hi> conceive; and which therefore he can much leſs <hi>expreſs</hi> with his <hi>Tongue.</hi> But yet that ſuch a Thing there will be, we may be ſatisfied by thoſe Diſcoveries, that Revelation has afforded us of it in the general. For, it is moſt certain, by ſuch Diſcoveries, that we ſhall at leaſt ſo enjoy <hi>God,</hi> as we do our <hi>Friend;</hi> we ſhall appear in his Preſence; in that <hi>Preſence, where there is fulneſs of Joy;</hi>
                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:49679:173"/>and at his <hi>Right-hand, where there are Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore.</hi> It is true indeed, that the Nature and infinite Variety of all ſorts of Unions (and, among the reſt, undoubtedly of thoſe, which God has reſerved for future Accompliſhments, and for future Diſcovery) are laid out of the Reach of all mortal Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. And therefore we ſhall reſt our ſelves ſatisfied with what is <hi>certain;</hi> or, at leaſt, with what, by the help of Revelation, we may eaſily <hi>believe</hi> to be ſo: That the Union of the Bleſſed with God in Heaven will be ſuch, as ſhall be ſufficient for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communications of each others Love; of the Love of the <hi>Creature</hi> in <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Praiſes</hi> offered up to God; of the Love of God in the Effuſions of ſuch <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Delight,</hi> ſuch <hi>agreeable Tranſports</hi> and <hi>Ecſtaſies,</hi> as ſhall fill the utmoſt Capacities of his Choſen ones; and ſhall therefore exceed their <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Wiſhes,</hi> becauſe their <hi>firſt</hi> Knowledge of ſuch their Happineſs can only come from their <hi>Experience</hi> of it; and that Experience alone will fully anſwer to, and gratifie their Self-love.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Laſtly, The Love of the glorified Saints to God will be ſtill further augmented, and indeed receive its full Complement and Perfection, by their Aſſurance, that all that Happineſs, of which they ſtand poſſeſſed at <hi>preſent,</hi> ſhall be <hi>eternal.</hi> For, a Fear of a Failure for the future, may daſh the Reliſh of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49679:174"/>the higheſt Enjoyment for the preſent; and our Satisfaction in the Poſſeſſion of any Good Thing (be it what it will) muſt needs be abated, if it be accompanied with a Doubt of its Continuance. But Happineſs with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity muſt needs be compleat and perfect. Nay, it muſt be ſo much the more compleat and perfect; becauſe tho the <hi>Continuance</hi> of Happineſs be <hi>future,</hi> yet the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of ſuch Continuance is <hi>preſent;</hi> and by ſuch <hi>Aſſurance</hi> we do in ſome Degree compendiouſly, and at the ſame time, enjoy both our <hi>preſent</hi> and our <hi>future</hi> Happineſs. Now the Bleſſed in Glory may <hi>therefore</hi> be <hi>ſecure</hi> of the <hi>Eternity</hi> of their Happineſs, becauſe God's Love ſtands <hi>immutably</hi> engaged to their <hi>Holineſs,</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſuch their <hi>Holineſs</hi> is <hi>indefectible</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi> For, where <hi>that</hi> is eternal, his <hi>Love</hi> moſt certainly is ſo too.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, in a few Words: Our Love of <hi>our ſelves</hi> makes us <hi>deſire</hi> to be happy: But it muſt be our Love of <hi>ſomething elſe,</hi> that muſt <hi>make</hi> us ſo. For, if the Love of our ſelves could of it ſelf <hi>make</hi> us happy, then it could not for that Reaſon engage us to <hi>deſire</hi> to be ſo. And nothing can conduce to our Happineſs, much leſs can any thing compleat it, but what is entertained by our Love.</p>
                     <p>When therefore we <hi>fix</hi> our Love upon that, which will anſwer the Deſires of our Self-love; we may then be ſure, that we love <hi>that,</hi> which <hi>may</hi> make us <hi>happy;</hi> and when
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49679:174"/>we come to <hi>poſſeſs</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> that, which we <hi>ſo</hi> love, we may be ſure, that we <hi>ſhall</hi> be happy; and if our Enjoyment of it be <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely</hi> eternal, we may then be farther aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that we ſhall be <hi>always</hi> ſo. And that our perfect Love of God, and our Enjoyment of his Love and Favour, will bring all theſe things to paſs, we hope our foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe has made good.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Now if the Happineſs of our future State in Glory ſhall come from <hi>our</hi> Love of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> Love of <hi>us;</hi> then this ſhould teach us to have a care, that we do not make our ſelves unfit for the Happineſs of Heaven, by our Uncharitableneſs whilſt we live here upon Earth. For, the Love of <hi>God</hi> will hardly be <hi>perfected</hi> in that Man, who does not love his <hi>Neighbour.</hi> For, <hi>He who loveth not his</hi> Brother, <hi>whom he</hi> hath <hi>ſeen; how ſhall he love</hi> God, <hi>whom he hath</hi> not <hi>ſeen?</hi> And he, who does not <hi>love</hi> God <hi>here,</hi> how ſhall his Love to him be <hi>perfected hereafter?</hi> For, that that is not, can never be made perfect.

It is remarkable, that our Saviour, when he taught his Diſciples to pray, (tho' he taught them to pray for <hi>ſeveral</hi> Things) yet annexes a <hi>Condition</hi> to that Petition <hi>alone,</hi> by which they were to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49679:175"/>their Sins; and afterwards gives them a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for his ſo doing; becauſe <hi>if</hi> they <hi>forgive not</hi> Men <hi>their Treſpaſſes, neither will their</hi> Father, <hi>who is in Heaven, forgive them</hi> their <hi>Treſpaſſes.</hi> By which we may underſtand, that as we ſhall not be admitted into Heaven, unleſs we be made <hi>like</hi> to God; and as we ſhall not be admitted into Heaven, unleſs <hi>God</hi> does forgive us <hi>our</hi> Sins; ſo neither ſhall we be admitted into Heaven, unleſs <hi>we</hi> be in <hi>this</hi> like to <hi>God,</hi> that we do forgive their Sins to <hi>others.</hi> In one Word, the malicious, ill-natur'd, and uncharitable Man is one of the worſt Companions in the World: For, he is very apt to do it <hi>always;</hi> and for the <hi>moſt</hi> part <hi>actually</hi> does make all People uneaſie, where he comes; and from thence we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that he is very unlikely to come in for a Share of <hi>that</hi> Happineſs, which conſiſts in <hi>Love.</hi> And for that Reaſon, we may be ſatisfied alſo, that till he lays aſide his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, it will be impoſſible, that he ſhould be made Partaker of the Happineſs of the Bleſſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If our eternal Happineſs muſt come from our ardent and eternal Love of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Holineſs;</hi> then we ſhould have a care, that we do not place our Religion, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence our Hopes of eternal Happineſs, in ſuch Things, which have <hi>no</hi> real Holineſs in them. For, it is a very great Miſtake, (which yet perhaps runs thro all Sorts of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>)
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49679:175"/>to think, that ſuch Things, that are not good and holy, will for ever make them happy. For, too many People do place not only their <hi>Religion,</hi> but their <hi>Zeal</hi> for it too, in ſuch little, and in themſelves inſignificant Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and Practices, which may be <hi>done,</hi> or may be <hi>let alone;</hi> and yet all the while they themſelves be never the more either religious or holy. For, what Holineſs (for Inſtance) can the Confeſſion of the Sinner, or the Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt, confer upon that Man, who has no other Deſign in his Confeſſion, but that he may go on to ſin upon a new Score, and ſo continue his Sin with a better Reliſh, and with the leſs Reluctance? Or, What Holineſs can the ſtrict Obſervance of the Sabbath beget in that Man, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only obliges himſelf to a greater Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon that Day, that he may by that Means compound with his Conſcience for his fraudulent Dealings, or his profligate and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Life, all the reſt of the Week? Or, How can any Man be the more holy, becauſe he liſts himſelf under this or that Party or Sect; when all the while he takes no care to do what God commands, or to avoid what God forbids? No! no! Holineſs is a real Thing, tho' it be not the Object of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: And this Thing only lodges in that Heart, which by an humble Obedience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms it ſelf to God's Will, and which, by hearkning to his Voice, is conformed to his
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49679:176"/>Likeneſs. And if any Man thinks to become Holy by any other Means, he does but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his own Soul, and by a fond and fooliſh Imagination exclude himſelf from that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which ſhall only be beſtowed upon thoſe, who ſhall be made like to him, who is moſt happy; that is, who ſhall be <hi>holy, as he is holy.</hi> All they then who would make themſelves <hi>happy,</hi> muſt take care, that they make themſelves <hi>holy.</hi> They muſt, I ſay, <hi>do ſo;</hi> and they muſt be <hi>pleaſed,</hi> that they <hi>have</hi> ſo done. For, he only <hi>loves</hi> God, who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi> in Holineſs; and he only ſhall be <hi>happy,</hi> who <hi>loves</hi> God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since it has appeared, that our moſt conſummate Happineſs does come from our perfect Love of Holineſs; and ſince perfect and unmixed <hi>Happineſs</hi> is moſt certainly our <hi>Aim:</hi> we do from thence conclude, That <hi>Holineſs</hi> ought in Prudence to be our <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> For, as it is a Short-ſightedneſs, and (at leaſt) a Degree of Folly, not to <hi>ſeek</hi> our Happineſs <hi>there,</hi> where it <hi>may</hi> be <hi>found;</hi> ſo not to ſeek it there, where we are <hi>truly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>rationally</hi> informed, that it may be found, is <hi>Madneſs.</hi> For, that Man may well be taxed of Frenzie, who will not take that Way to Happineſs, to which he is directed by ſuch Advice, which is inculcated by the joint Suggeſtions of Revelation and Reaſon, that is, by the ordinary and extraordinary Light, that God holds out to direct him in ſuch Way.</p>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:49679:176"/>
                     <p>Now, to ſet home this Exhortation, by convincing Men, that the true and rational Way to their Happineſs is by Holineſs, (beſides all that has hitherto been offered) I would propoſe to their ſerious Conſideration theſe Things following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That that Religion, which has been confirmed by Prophecies from the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, <hi>before</hi> it was revealed; and which, <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> it was revealed, was confirmed by Multitudes of other <hi>Miracles,</hi> and by the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of him from the Dead, who did reveal it; muſt as certainly have God for its Author, as it is certain, that ſuch Miracles and ſuch Predictions could only come from God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and no other Religion, either truly or falſely ſo called, is the Religion which has this Character, and therefore has God for its Author.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Religion, which has God for its Author, muſt needs be a true Religion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That Religion, which has God for its Author, muſt needs be an holy Religion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Since it is one of the greateſt Buſineſſes of Religion to inſtruct Men how to ſerve God; the true Religion muſt, even becauſe it is true, inſtruct Men how to ſerve God <hi>truly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. He who <hi>truly</hi> ſerves God, who is moſt <hi>holy,</hi> muſt do ſo by living <hi>holily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:49679:177"/>
                     <p n="7">7. He who lives holily, pleaſes God: For, he complies with the Inſtructions of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of which God is the Author.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. He who pleaſes God, by complying with the Inſtructions of that Religion, of which God is the Author, ſhall not fall ſhort of the End, that God intended in his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Now it is moſt certain, that God <hi>inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Religion</hi> for the <hi>Sake</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> of <hi>Man;</hi> and it as certain, that God <hi>wills</hi> the <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Man:</hi> And therefore it is rational to infer, That God inſtituted Religion to direct Man in the true Way to Happineſs; and that Way (we have ſeen) is Holineſs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From all which I would infer, Firſt, that which is to my preſent Deſign, That the only Way for us to obtain Happineſs, is by our Practice of Holineſs: And, what is not indeed ſo direct to my purpoſe, but yet of good uſe,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the beſt and ſureſt Way of gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Enquiries after the True Religion, will be to keep our Eye, all the while we are ſo employed, ſtedfaitly fixed upon Holineſs. For, we can much better tell what is good and honeſt, than we can tell what is true. Our Knowledge of the firſt therefore may prove a very good Guide to us in our Search after the laſt. To which I would add,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That to talk of Truth and Certainty, and much more of Infallibility in Religion,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49679:177"/>when the Determinations and Reſolutions of ſuch Certainty or Infallibility are miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous or pernicious to the real Happineſs of Mankind, or any other ways wicked, is Nonſenſe and Banter; and is in deed and truth an Impoſition upon Mens Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in order to damnifie the honeſt and real Intereſts, and true Happineſs of Mankind. But to return to our Deſign.</p>
                     <p>That Men may be the more heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>believe</hi> what has been <hi>ſaid,</hi> and to <hi>practiſe</hi> what they ſhall ſo <hi>believe;</hi> I ſhall ſtill go on to preſs the preſent Exhortation more home, by adviſing them to try the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether the Doctrine now delivered (which is, That our Happineſs muſt come from our Practice and Love of Holineſs) be true or no. The Propoſal is fair and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and there is no Man who has not one way or other made a great many Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Caſe: For, our conſtant Deſire of Happineſs will always be putting us upon ſuch Experiments. And I dare be bold to ſay, before we proceed any farther, that if any Man's Trial has ſucceeded, his Succeſs does fall in with my Propoſal, and back the preſent Exhortation.</p>
                     <p>Now, becauſe our Happineſs cannot (as we have ſeen) ſo much as be ſuppoſed to be lodged abroad; but if it be our Happineſs, it muſt, for that Reaſon, be lodged within us, at home, and in our own poſſeſſion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49679:178"/>to engage Men to <hi>entertain</hi> our preſent <hi>Exhortation</hi> the more <hi>heartily,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fequence to <hi>make</hi> the Trial of the propoſed <hi>Experiment</hi> the more <hi>willingly;</hi> I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them, by a ſerious Reflection, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether all Wickedneſs does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly bring Miſery along with it into that Breaſt, where it ſelf is entertained. For, if we ſuppoſe a Man to be wicked, we muſt at the ſame time, for the moſt part, (for, there is but one excepted Caſe) ſuppoſe, that he knows that he is ſo. And when that is once ſuppoſed, ſuch a Suppoſition will acquaint us with theſe following Truths: That he will have <hi>one Thought</hi> employed upon God's <hi>Law,</hi> which commands his <hi>Duty;</hi> and <hi>another</hi> Thought upon his own <hi>Actions,</hi> which <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> that <hi>Law;</hi> and a <hi>third</hi> Thought, which ſhall, by comparing the one with the other, diſcover the <hi>Diſagreement,</hi> nay the <hi>Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> that is between the <hi>Law,</hi> and ſuch his <hi>Actions.</hi> Now, here are already Thoughts diſagreeing and fighting with each other, and by that Means a Civil War raiſed in his Breaſt; the Effects of which, in all Caſes, are ſure to be not only <hi>miſchievous,</hi> but <hi>cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous.</hi> Let us then ſee a little farther, and let us ſuppoſe (what will yet be more than ſuppoſed, for it will be certain:) But, I ſay, let us ſuppoſe, that when by <hi>one Thought</hi> the Man has diſcovered the Contrariety between his <hi>own Actions,</hi> and the <hi>Directive</hi> Part of the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:49679:178"/>Law, that thereupon he beſtows <hi>another</hi> Thought upon the <hi>Vindictive</hi> Part of the Law, (and ſuch a Chain of Thoughts is very natural) and that by <hi>another</hi> Thought he <hi>applies</hi> ſuch Vindictive Part of the Law, that is, the Threat of the Law, to his own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and, by conſequence, to his own dear Self. And when this is once done, then we may begin to be ſatisſied, that Multitudes of other Thoughts will preſently riſe in his Breaſt, and thoſe too filled with Doubt, and Fear, and Shame, and Grief, and all thoſe other troubleſom, vexatious, and tormenting Paſſions, which are the natural Effects that follow upon the Contemplation of our own Guilt. Now, when all theſe boyſterous and vexatious Thoughts do oppoſe themſelves <hi>againſt,</hi> and make violent Aſſaults <hi>upon</hi> a Man's natural Deſire of Eaſe, Content, and Happineſs, what a Storm and Tempeſt muſt they, by ſo doing, raiſe in that Soul, where they all meet, and where they all rage and contend? The poor Man, in this Caſe, will (in the Words of the Prophet) be <hi>like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe Waters caſt up Mire and Dirt:</hi> That is, Filth and Wickedneſs is the Cauſe of his Diſquiet; and Tumult, Confuſion, and Agony are the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſuch Filth and Wickedneſs: For, <hi>there is no Peace to the Wicked, ſaith God;</hi> and we may be ſure, that what God ſaith, is true: For, when our own Thoughts do tell us,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:49679:179"/>that the Miſeries which they bring upon us, they do therefore ſo bring, becauſe we have offended and diſpleaſed our God; they do, by ſo doing, add one <hi>great</hi> Miſery to all our <hi>other</hi> Miſeries. For, in all other Afflictions we have ſtill a Place of Refuge left; and, like a City beſieged, tho' all our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations with the Comforts of this World be hindred and intercepted, yet our Intercourſe with Heaven is ſtill left free and open, and in God we have a ſure Retreat. But when our Miſery ſprings from our own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we do at the ſame time loſe our <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and our <hi>Hopes</hi> of Relief too; becauſe our Miſery comes from his Hand, who has all Relief and all Happineſs in his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.</p>
                     <p>I have deſcribed theſe Things in a plain, familiar, and natural Way, becauſe I would have People convinced of their Truth, without the Trouble or Expence of a Trial. (For, tho' I <hi>would</hi> have them try, whether <hi>Goodneſs</hi> will not make them <hi>happy;</hi> yet I would <hi>not</hi> have them try, whether <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> will not make them <hi>miſerable.</hi>) For, the Experiment in this Caſe will be too dear and coſtly. And that muſt needs be ſo, which deſtroys our Peace, by robbing us of the <hi>Peace</hi> of God. And if Men are but in ſome moderate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſatisfied of the Truth of theſe Things, it may be hoped, (and God grant that our Hope do not deceive us) that they will by
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49679:179"/>that means be engaged to try, whether Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will make them happy, or no. For, now they have a fair and farther Probability of Succeſs to invite them to ſuch a Trial; becauſe Holineſs and Wickedneſs being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the one to the other, our Reaſon will teach us more than barely to conjecture, that they muſt produce contrary Eſſects. For, if (as we have ſeen) Miſery, Confuſion, and Agony are ſure to be the Effects of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it may the more reaſonably be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Effects of Holineſs ſhould be Joy and Happineſs; and therefore it may be the more reaſonably expected alſo, that Men ſhould be perſuaded to purſue their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the Practice of Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>And it may be farther expected yet, that Men ſhould be ſo perſuaded, becauſe (which yet may ſeem ſtrange) there is hardly any wicked Man, tho' he be ranked among thoſe whom the World do commonly account Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate) but who yet has ſo much Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Comforts of Holineſs, as might (would he but uſe his natural Reaſon in the Caſe) engage him to attempt the Encreaſe of ſuch his Comforts, by becoming holy. For, tho' he be guilty of <hi>many,</hi> perhaps of <hi>moſt</hi> Sins; yet he <hi>cannot</hi> be guilty of <hi>all.</hi> For, Sin is not only an Abſurdity in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and a downright Contradiction to all ſober Reaſon; but it is in many Caſes a Contradiction alſo to it ſelf. For, <hi>one</hi> Sin ſhall ſtand in ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:49679:180"/>to <hi>another,</hi> that it ſhall in a manner be impoſſible for <hi>both</hi> of them to be Retainers to the <hi>ſame</hi> Man. For, it is as impoſſible to conceive, that a profeſſed and profligate <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchée</hi> (while he is what he is) ſhould be an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> as it is, that he ſhould <hi>proclaim</hi> and <hi>conceal</hi> his Wickedneſs at one and the ſelf-ſame time. And yet, even ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchée, thus abandoned to all ſorts of Vices, as far as <hi>Poſſibility</hi> and his own <hi>profligate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> will permit, ſhall value himſelf for his Forbearance of that Vice, from which yet he does not therefore forbear, becauſe it is a <hi>Vice,</hi> but becauſe (ſhould he admit it to his Practice) it would <hi>thwart</hi> and <hi>controul</hi> his other many and beloved Vices. And we cannot but ſometimes obſerve, that ſome Men, who heartily hug Covetouſneſs, and all thoſe Vices which drudge under its Direction, ſuch as are Extortion, Oppreſſion, Fraud, Lying, Perjury, and all manner of Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs, ſhall yet raiſe a Comfort to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they are ſober, and free from Drunkenneſs. Theſe Things, as ſtrange as they are, yet are too often found to be true. And the preſent Uſe that we make of them, is this: That very wicked Men, and even ſuch, whoſe Vices are very <hi>numerous</hi> and very <hi>black,</hi> ſhall yet, for all that, perceive ſuch a Beauty and Excellency only in abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from other Vices, which are not their <hi>own.</hi> that they ſhall gather Comfort to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49679:180"/>from ſuch their Abſtinence; and that therefore even ſuch Men are not utterly void of all Senſe, that the Practice of Vertue is a pleaſant and comfortable Thing; and that, by conſequence, there is an Happineſs which does attend and follow it. And then, if it be ſo true, that Holineſs or Vertue (for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Practical Holineſs are one and the ſame Thing;) But, I ſay, if it be ſo true, that Holineſs has Happineſs for its Companion and Follower; that the moſt <hi>wicked</hi> Men are <hi>ſenſible</hi> of it, and that all <hi>other</hi> Men do <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi> it; then it is hoped, that the preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation will be admitted, and that is, That all Men would try to make themſelves <hi>happy,</hi> by making themſelves <hi>holy.</hi> And it will be a very hard Caſe, if Men will not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the trouble of trying that Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which their own Senſe of the Thing, and the Senſe of all other Men beſides, will tell them muſt needs ſucceed; and which, when it does ſucceed, muſt needs make them happy.</p>
                     <p>And thus far the preſent Exhortation is more profeſſedly directed to thoſe, who are in a manner utter <hi>Strangers</hi> to the Ways of God, and ſo have need of a Guide to <hi>enter</hi> them into the right Way.</p>
                     <p>To all others, I have but One or Two Things to ſay, and ſo ſhall conclude the whole Matter.</p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:49679:181"/>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, Becauſe I do ſuppoſe them not to be wholly Strangers to Holineſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would adviſe them to look back to their own Experience in the Caſe: And tho' perhaps that Experience may not be much; yet, ſuch as it is, I am very confident, that their own Reflections will tell them, that whenever they <hi>did</hi> any Duty <hi>heartily</hi> and <hi>ſincerely,</hi> they did not go without all <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,</hi> that they <hi>had</hi> ſo done: That when they have <hi>done</hi> as they <hi>ought,</hi> their Condition has <hi>been</hi> as they <hi>deſired:</hi> That when their <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> have been guided by their <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and their <hi>Conſcience</hi> has been guided by <hi>God's</hi> Law, they have thereupon been bleſſed with calm and comfortable Reflections: That a diligent and conſtant Diſcharge of their Duty has therefore kept their <hi>Souls</hi> at peace with <hi>themſelves,</hi> becauſe they have then been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that <hi>God</hi> has been at peace with their <hi>Souls.</hi> Now, ſuch Comforts and ſmaller Happineſſes as theſe, becauſe they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanied and been proportionate to their <hi>fainter</hi> Love of Holineſs, have given in ſufficient Evidence, that their <hi>Happineſs</hi> ſhall then be <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> when their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> ſhall be ſo: And by having ſo done, may inforce our preſent Exhortation, which is, That by <hi>growing</hi> in Grace, and by <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> in the Love of God and Goodneſs, they ſhould fit themſelves for an <hi>eternal</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For, by what has been ſaid, they may
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49679:181"/>now begin to be ſatisfied, that when their Saviour requires of them to <hi>love the</hi> Lord <hi>their</hi> God <hi>with all their Hearts, with all their Souls, with all their Strength, and with all their Minds,</hi> he does in effect require of them to love their own <hi>Souls;</hi> ſince it is by this time notorious, that what in this Caſe is their <hi>Duty,</hi> will prove not only their true <hi>Way</hi> to Happineſs, but that it will alſo put them into the actual <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of ſuch Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I would add, in the ſecond place, That if we do not ſincerely <hi>love</hi> Holineſs, and by conſequence <hi>deſire</hi> it, we ſhall never attain to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of it: And if we fall ſhort of a <hi>perfect</hi> Holineſs, we ſhall by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence fall ſhort of <hi>Eternal</hi> Happineſs. For, our Saviour will not beſtow a <hi>perfect</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there, where it is not <hi>deſired;</hi> and it cannot be <hi>deſired</hi> there, where it is not <hi>loved.</hi> We muſt therefore <hi>fit our</hi> ſelves to <hi>be</hi> made perfectly holy, as well as he is <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>make</hi> us ſo. For, as we have ſeen already, that thoſe only who <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt</hi> after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſhall be <hi>ſatisfied;</hi> ſo we ſhall here add, That thoſe only who are ſo <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> ſhall be <hi>bleſſed.</hi>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IT may be perceived, by the very Title, that I would be thought (however I have all along worded my ſelf) to propoſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Eſſay</hi> (for ſo I would chuſe to call it) only Problematically. For which Reaſon I have ſeparated it from the foregoing Diſcourſe, and have caſt it here by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>If it be found true, it cannot for that Reaſon be condemned of Novelty, becauſe it is wholly grounded upon the Scripture, and goes no farther, than thoſe Conſequences, which That affords, will warrant.</p>
                  <p>And if it be found true, it may perhaps be found uſeful alſo for the Reſolving of more Difficulties in Religion, than what it expreſly pretends to.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49679:184"/>
                  <p>But I was unwilling to adventure too far; and therefore deſire the Reader to take it in good Part, ſuch as it, at preſent, offers it ſelf to him.</p>

                  <head>A SHORT INQUIRY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT has been our profeſſed Buſineſs, in the foregoing Diſcourſe, to make it out, That <hi>there is no other Name under Heaven, but that of Jeſus Chriſt, given to Men, whereby they muſt be ſaved.</hi> Which, becauſe it is a Truth only made known by <hi>Revelation;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is attended with ſome <hi>Difficulties,</hi> which our <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> cannot eaſily <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount;</hi> has therefore (of <hi>late</hi> eſpecially) been ſlighted (to ſay no worſe) by <hi>ſome</hi> Men, who call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but who, for all that, will allow nothing to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, but the Belief of a <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to ſuch Belief; and therefore who are deſirous at leaſt to lay aſide all Revelation whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Now, tho' others, who have looked <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> into the Matter, cannot perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>renounce</hi> God's Revelations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Saviour,</hi> made to Man in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtaments,</hi> which do indeed carry ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence in themſelves of their Divine Authority; the main Drift and Deſign of the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:49679:185"/>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> being to <hi>foretell</hi> and <hi>prefigure</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> with other Things relating to his Birth, Life, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the main Drift and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the <hi>Laſt</hi> being to exhibit to us the <hi>Accompliſhment</hi> of what had been ſo foretold and prefigured:) For, <hi>the</hi> Teſtimony <hi>of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the</hi> Spirit <hi>of Prophecy;</hi> and the Spirit of <hi>Prophecy</hi> is the Spirit of <hi>God:</hi> Yet even ſome of theſe Men do ſo treat the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Revelations, as to employ their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rather to <hi>expound</hi> away thoſe Difficulties, than to <hi>reſolve</hi> them; by that means <hi>rejecting</hi> the moſt expreſs Meaning of a great Part of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and ſo <hi>cutting</hi> thoſe Knots, which they perhaps therefore only <hi>cannot,</hi> becauſe they <hi>will</hi> not try to <hi>untie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now tho' we have attempted to reſolve ſeveral ſuch Difficulties, (and ſome of them in ſuch a way, which, we hope, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade thinking Men, that, provided they hold faſt the Foundation, they are not always obliged to tread in beaten Paths:) Yet one grand Difficulty ſtill remains; and that is, That if Men are to obtain Salvation by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt alone,</hi> and if ſuch a Doctrine can only be known by <hi>Revelation;</hi> then it may ſeem ſtrange (at leaſt) that the Revelation is not made <hi>known</hi> to <hi>all</hi> Men. And it may ſeem the more ſtrange, that it is not ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in thoſe very Revelations, which we have of it, we find expreſly, that the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49679:185"/>deſigned in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> was <hi>intended</hi> for all Men: And it is natural to think, that that which is deſigned for the <hi>Benefit</hi> of all, ſhould be <hi>exhibited</hi> to all; and that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when ſuch Deſign is the Counſel of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Omnipotence.</hi> Beſides, if the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Saviour was neceſſary for <hi>any;</hi> then, either immediately or mediately, it muſt be neceſſary for <hi>All;</hi> becauſe if any of thoſe Men, to whom it is <hi>not</hi> made, may be ſaved <hi>without</hi> it; then, ſo might thoſe, to whom it <hi>was</hi> made; and ſo the Revelation (as to its <hi>neceſſity</hi> to Salvation) might have been wholly ſpared. For which Reaſon, we cannot think it ſufficient to ſay, that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> knows <hi>all Men,</hi> and ſo can <hi>ſave them;</hi> tho' <hi>all</hi> Men do not know the <hi>Saviour,</hi> and ſo cannot <hi>believe</hi> on <hi>him.</hi> And therefore the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> do expreſly aſſign our Salvation, on <hi>our</hi> Part, to our <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;</hi> and they do as expreſly make our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the Saving <hi>Object</hi> of ſuch our Belief. And therefore, tho' the Author of <hi>The Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtianity</hi> has ſhewed himſelf no great Friend to Articles of Chriſtian Faith, and therefore does at leaſt pretend to wipe away the Neceſſity of all <hi>other</hi> Articles in our <hi>Creed</hi> but <hi>this,</hi> That <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> yet he does not adventure <hi>ſo far,</hi> as to exclude the Neceſſity of <hi>that</hi> Article. My Buſineſs is not with that Author at preſent; and therefore having taken notice, that he
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49679:186"/>does ſo far agree with me, I ſhall proceed: Only I would by the bye remark, That tho' <hi>that</hi> be the firſt and leading Article of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> (for without the Belief of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> there can no more be any ſuch thing as <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> than without the Belief of a <hi>God</hi> there can be ſuch a Thing as <hi>Religion;</hi>) yet for all that, it will be true, that as a Religion grounded upon the Belief of the <hi>true</hi> God, may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be a <hi>falſe</hi> Religion; ſo a <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> grounded upon the Belief of the <hi>true Chriſt,</hi> may however be a <hi>falſe Chriſtianity.</hi> For, as notwithſtanding a <hi>Belief,</hi> or, which may be ſomething more, the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the True God, Men may fall into <hi>Idolatry;</hi> [See <hi>Rom. chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22, 23.] So, notwithſtanding the Belief not only of the <hi>true Chriſt,</hi> but of his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> alſo, Men may have no other Expectations from him, but <hi>Wealth, Power,</hi> and <hi>Grandeur</hi> in this World; [See <hi>Acts ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 6.] And yet I do hardly think, that a Faith either in the <hi>one Caſe</hi> or in the <hi>other,</hi> will by that Author be thought a <hi>Saving</hi> Faith: And if it be not, then it will appear a good Concluſion, That in the <hi>laſt</hi> Caſe, that is, in the Caſe of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſomething <hi>more</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed in order to our Salvation, than barely, that <hi>Jeſus is the Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, as I ſaid before, this by the bye. That which is directly to our preſent Purpoſe, is, That if it be true, that <hi>none</hi> ſhall be ſaved, who do not believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:49679:186"/>the Saviour; then how ſhall we account for the future Condition of thoſe, who in this Life never <hi>heard</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> For, tho' we may out of the Scriptures be taught, That <hi>he who believeth, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and, that <hi>he who believeth not, ſhall be damned:</hi> Yet ſtill we cannot but know, that that <hi>Disbelief</hi> to which <hi>Damnation</hi> is allotted, muſt be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that <hi>Belief</hi> to which <hi>Salvation</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted, as <hi>Damnation</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> are to each other. Now becauſe that <hi>Belief,</hi> to which <hi>Salvation</hi> is allotted, is an Act of the <hi>Will,</hi> (whatever the Schools teach of Faith being lodged only in the Underſtanding;) therefore we do conclude, That that <hi>Disbelief,</hi> to which <hi>Damnation</hi> is allotted, muſt be an Act of the <hi>Will</hi> too. And indeed, ſince <hi>Damnation</hi> is confeſſedly the <hi>Reward</hi> of Unbelief; and ſince this <hi>Reward</hi> is to come from the Hand of ſuch Juſtice, which cannot <hi>err;</hi> we may from thence be aſſured, that the Unbelief, to which it is allotted, muſt be <hi>Criminal;</hi> and we are moreover aſſured, that nothing can be ſo, in which the <hi>Will</hi> is not at all concerned. Now, becauſe it is moſt certain, that thoſe who in this World <hi>never heard</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> do not therefore not believe in him, becauſe they <hi>will</hi> not, but only becauſe they <hi>cannot:</hi> I ſay, for that Reaſon it will be unjuſt to aſign that Damnation to their Unbelief, that is, by them unavoidable; which is by the Scriptures aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only to that Unbelief: which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:49679:187"/>
                     <hi>Criminal,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Voluntary.</hi> Tho' therefore Damnation be by the Scriptures pronounced againſt that Unbelief, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes the Saviour <hi>made known</hi> and <hi>offered</hi> to Men; yet we cannot from thence conclude, that it ſhall be the Portion of that Unbelief, which is only a Conſequence of an <hi>unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Ignorance of the ſame Saviour.</p>
                  <p>And as we cannot from the Scriptures conclude, that they who <hi>never heard</hi> of the Saviour, ſhall <hi>be damned for</hi> their <hi>Unbelief:</hi> So neither can we from them conclude, that they ſhall <hi>be ſaved, notwithſtanding</hi> their <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi> For, if a Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it will from thence follow, that they who <hi>want</hi> that Faith, muſt <hi>go without</hi> that Salvation, to which it is <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, it may be preſumed, that far the <hi>greater</hi> Part of Mankind, if not in <hi>all,</hi> yet in <hi>moſt</hi> Ages, and that therefore much the greater Part of Mankind in <hi>general, never</hi> had the Saviour made known to them; which, if it be true, (as we have no reaſon to doubt the truth of it) then it will follow,</p>
                  <p>That tho' God has provided a Saviour for all Men; yet by making a Faith in that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour a neceſſary Condition for Man's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raining the provided Salvation, he has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by excluded the greater Part of Mankind from ſuch Salvation; becauſe by having <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the Times before appointed, and the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:49679:187"/>Bounds of their Habitation,</hi> he has by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo placed them in the World, that it is to them impoſſible to come to ſo <hi>much Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the Saviour, as is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>their Belief</hi> in him.</p>
                  <p>And if this Concluſion be true, it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us another, which is, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God has in a Saviour made ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Proviſion for the Salvation of all Men; yet the greater Part of Men ſhall fall ſhort of ſuch Salvation, and that too without their own Default.</p>
                  <p>Now, it is freely confeſſed, that our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Saviour, laid the Deſign of <hi>extending</hi> that Salvation, which he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as <hi>wide,</hi> as was the <hi>Merit</hi> of his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; that is, his Purchaſe was <hi>ſufficient</hi> for the Salvation of <hi>all Men;</hi> and he gave ſuch Directions and Injunctions for the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to all Men <hi>ſo much</hi> Knowledge of ſuch his Purchaſe, as might be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to bring them to that Faith, which might <hi>intitle</hi> them to the <hi>Benefit</hi> of it. And therefore we find, that he commanded his Apoſtles <hi>to go into</hi> all <hi>the World, and to preach the Goſpel to</hi> every <hi>Creature;</hi> and that he gave them <hi>Abilities</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> ſuch his Command, by beſtowing on them, and many of thoſe who ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by them, the <hi>Gift</hi> of Tongues, and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>working Miracles.</hi> By which Means there was Proviſion made for the <hi>Faith</hi> of all, as well as for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49679:188"/>all; for the <hi>Means,</hi> as well as for the <hi>End.</hi> But yet becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Propagating the Means of Faith, that is, becauſe the Propagating the Goſpel to all Mankind, was left in the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and, for that Reaſon, was not likely to be performed according to the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> inſomuch that he, who is both <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> does before his departure out of this World make it a Queſtion, Whether, upon his Return, he ſhould find Faith in it; <hi>Shall the ſon of man, when he cometh, find faith upon the earth?</hi> And becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it was likely, that thoſe Men, who had the Means of Faith and Salvation them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>would</hi> not; ſo it has been found by Experience, that they <hi>have</hi> not, at leaſt they have not ſo <hi>induſtriouſly</hi> propagated ſuch Means, as that they ſhould reach to all others: And becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Tho' any Man may defeat the Counſel of God for his <hi>own</hi> Salvation, and (if he do ſo) his Damnation will not only be <hi>juſt,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary;</hi> yet it is not agreeable to the Equity of the Divine Juſtice, that it ſhould be in the Power of any Man to defeat the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God for the Salvation of any <hi>other</hi> Man:</p>
                  <p>I ſay, from theſe Things laid together, it may ſeem no improbable Concluſion, That God will by ſome way or other make known his Counſel (to <hi>all</hi> Men) for their Salvation, as he has already done ſo to <hi>ſome:</hi> And that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:49679:188"/>he will alſo make them acquainted with the <hi>Conditions,</hi> that he requires of them, in order to their being made Partakers of ſuch Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, he will make them acquainted with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> their Saviour, and with his Doctrine and Laws.</p>
                  <p>And then, to come up cloſe to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, at which we have all along aimed; Since we know by Experience, that God has not by any Means made all Men acquainted with theſe Things in <hi>this</hi> Life, that therefore he will do it in a <hi>future</hi> Life.</p>
                  <p>And it ſeems to me, that he has given us ſufficient Grounds to believe, that he will do ſo, in <hi>thoſe</hi> very <hi>Revelations,</hi> which he has already afforded us to guide us in the Way of Salvat on. For, tho' the <hi>generality</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and, by their Way of wording them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether in their Popular Diſcourſes or in their Writings, one would be inclined to think, that the <hi>generality</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> too do conceive, that the Reſurrection of all Men will be cauſed at <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> time; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps invited to ſuch a Perſuaſion, becauſe, as the Scriptures do tell us, that a Reſurrection is in order to a General Judgment, ſo they do aſſign but <hi>one</hi> Day to that Judgment, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therefore <hi>the Day of Judgment:</hi> Yet we may do well to conſider, That <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Expreſſions</hi> are very ſeldom <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>full Narratives:</hi> And if, in this very Caſe, the Scriptures, where they deſcend to a more
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:49679:189"/>
                     <hi>particular</hi> Account of the Matter, do give us in a <hi>different</hi> Information, and ſo do aſſure us, that the Reſurrection of all Men ſhall <hi>not</hi> be at one and the ſame time; but that there is a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Period of Time ſet out for the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>ſome</hi> Men, from that which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Reſurrection of <hi>others;</hi> then we hope, it will not be thought an Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, if we ſhall aſſert, That there will be <hi>more</hi> Reſurrections than <hi>one;</hi> or, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſpeaks our Meaning plainer, That <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorts</hi> of Men, according to the <hi>Tariety</hi> of their Behaviour, and other their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in <hi>this</hi> World, ſhall be raiſed, not only in <hi>different Conditions,</hi> but alſo at <hi>differeut Times,</hi> in the <hi>next</hi> World: And thoſe Times too (as will appear from what will be ſpoken hereafter) at Diſtances conſiderably remote from each other.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Scriptures, in the Twentieth Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> do acquaint us with a three-fold Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Firſt is, of thoſe Men, who <hi>were Martyrs for Jeſus, and for the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. By which I underſtand <hi>all</hi> the Faithful in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> tho' I do not in this Place contend the Truth of ſuch Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to it hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Second Reſurrection is in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. where we are told, that <hi>the</hi> reſt <hi>of the Dead lived not again,</hi> till <hi>the thouſand Years were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:49679:189"/>
                  <p>Now, thoſe who are ſaid to be <hi>firſt</hi> raiſed, in the Fourth Verſe, are there alſo ſaid to <hi>reign</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> a <hi>thouſand</hi> Years. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we are told, in the Fifth Verſe, that <hi>the</hi> reſt <hi>of the Dead lived not again, till the thouſand Tears were</hi> finiſhed, it is implied, that then they <hi>did</hi> live again. So that a <hi>thouſand</hi> Years do intervene between the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Reſurrection. And tho' it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the latter end of the Fifth Verſe, <hi>[This is the firſt Reſurrection;]</hi> yet it is evident, that <hi>that</hi> cannot be meant of the Reſurrection in the <hi>Fifth</hi> Verſe, becauſe we had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made acquainted with a Reſurrection which was a thouſand Years <hi>before</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>I therefore take the whole Sentence in the former part of the Fifth Verſe, <hi>[But the reſt of the Dead lived not, till the thouſand Years were finiſhed,]</hi> to be Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eptical, and to come in in a <hi>Parentheſis:</hi> For, indeed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place is between the Sixth and Seventh Verſes.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore ſee how the Senſe will go, if we remove them <hi>from</hi> the Place where they ſtand at preſent, and place them <hi>between</hi> the Sixth and Seventh Verſes.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand Years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ver. 5. <hi>This is the firſt Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he, that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection: On ſuch the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord Death hath no power; but they ſhall be
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49679:190"/>Prieſts of God and of Chriſt, and ſhall reign with him a thouſand Years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if in this Place we bring in thoſe Words in the Fifth Verſe, <hi>[But the reſt,</hi> &amp;c.] the Senſe will go thus;</p>

                  <p>By which it is plain, that if the Sentence at the beginning of the Fifth Verſe be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and placed between the Sixth and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-Verſes, then the Senſe, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning both the Firſt and Second Reſurrection, will be entire and continued, and alſo will be plain, eaſie, and natural.</p>
                  <p>Now, from the Words thus reſtored to their natural and true Order, we do to our preſent purpoſe take notice,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they, who have behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as <hi>faithful Chriſtians</hi> in this Life, ſhall be raiſed <hi>firſt</hi> in the next Life, 1 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. That as our Saviour, after his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, continued upon <hi>Earth</hi> Forty Days,

                  <p n="8">8.

                  <p>One Thing more we muſt remark upon this Firſt Reſurrection, and that is, that it ſhall not be brought to paſs till the Laſt Day; by which I underſtand, the laſt Day of the Oeconomy of this World, or the Day of our Saviour's firſt Coming to Judgment. Conſult St. <hi>John, chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 39, 40. At which Day, as the Faithful, whether dead, (and then raiſed) or remaining, (or not yet dead) <hi>ſhall

From whence we conclude, That as the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhall <hi>be caught up to meet the Lord in the Air;</hi> ſo the Wicked and Unbelievers, that remain in the Earth, ſhall be deſtroyed by that general Conflagration.</p>
                  <p>From whence we have a plauſible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that, which we have called <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reſurrection;</hi> which is the Reſurrection of <hi>ſome</hi> Men (whoever they be at preſent) <hi>after</hi> the Reſurrection of the <hi>Righteous:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>after</hi> the Reſurrection of the Faithful, and the Deſtruction of all the reſt by Fire, as aforeſaid; and not only ſo, but alſo a <hi>thouſand</hi> Years after that, Satan is let looſe to deceive the Nations. Now, after the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conflagration, there could be <hi>no Nations</hi> to be deceived, if there were <hi>no Reſurrection.</hi> They therefore, whom he is to deceive, are thoſe who were raiſed in the Fifth Verſe, as was before ſaid: For, he cannot deceive thoſe of the Firſt Reſurrection, for many obvious Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>But farther to aſſert this Second Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to clear ſuch Doubts as may ariſe concerning it, we ſhall enquire into theſe following Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who thoſe Men are, that ſhall be raiſed by it?</p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:49679:192"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Why the Devil is let looſe to deceive them?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why they are called <hi>the Nations?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Who is <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog?</hi> For, as we ſhall ſee by and by, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> muſt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Second Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And for an Anſwer to the firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Who thoſe are, who ſhall be raiſed by the ſecond Reſurrection? We muſt take notice, that the Scriptures do tell us, what it has been our Buſineſs in the foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to prove,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>there is not Salvation in any other, but in Jeſus Chriſt alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſame Scriptures do tell us, That thoſe Men, who ſhall be ſaved by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt believe in him; that is, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him for their Saviour, and admit the Conditions of that Covenant, which he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in order to their Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſame Scriptures, and our natural Reaſon do tell us, That <hi>Men cannot believe in him, of whom they have not heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And we are aſſured by Experience, not only, that many <hi>Men,</hi> but that many <hi>Nations</hi> of Men, and that too through <hi>moſt,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> Ages of the World, have not heard of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. And yet we know by the Scriptures, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came to ſave <hi>all</hi> Men; that he died for <hi>all;</hi> that <hi>God wills not, that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:49679:192"/>and be ſaved:</hi> with much more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And we are aſſured, That where God <hi>wills</hi> the Salvation of <hi>all</hi> Men, and where he has <hi>provided Means</hi> ſufficient for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>all</hi> Men; that there he <hi>will</hi> not, (we may perhaps ſay, <hi>cannot</hi>) in Truth, Equity, and Juſtice, ſo order Things by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that <hi>many,</hi> nay, the <hi>moſt</hi> part of thoſe Men (for whom, as well as for the reſt, he provided, and therefore deſigned Salvation) ſhould be put in <hi>ſuch</hi> Circumſtances, and that <hi>without</hi> their own <hi>Fault,</hi> as that it ſhould be utterly impoſſible for them to come to the Knowledge of their Saviour and his Goſpel, and, by conſequence, to a Poſſibility of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Now from theſe Propoſitions, ſo laid down, we do infer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That at <hi>ſome</hi> time or <hi>other, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall be made <hi>known</hi> to <hi>all</hi> Men, before they ſhall by him be called to Judgment, to give an Account, whether they have received and believed in him, or not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all thoſe Men, to whom <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Goſpel was never made known <hi>before their Death,</hi> ſhall yet be made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them <hi>after their Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in order to our more full Satisfaction in theſe Concluſions, we take notice far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:49679:193"/>
                  <p n="1">1. That all, upon whom a final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall paſs, that is, all Men, are by the Scriptures ranged into Two Sorts; Thoſe who ſhall be ſaved, and thoſe who ſhall be damned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That thoſe, with whoſe Reſurrection we are made acquainted, from the Fifth to the Ninth Verſe of the Twentieth of <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> incluſive, were raiſed <hi>after</hi> the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the Fourth Verſe is <hi>over;</hi> and were raiſed and gone <hi>before</hi> the Reſurrection in the Eleventh, Twelfth, and following Verſes does <hi>commence,</hi> which are expreſly Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Remuneration;</hi> whereas thoſe of this <hi>ſecond</hi> Reſurrection, are not, <hi>during</hi> the Time that their Reſurrection laſts, called to any <hi>final</hi> Judgment, for any Thing that they had done in <hi>this</hi> Life; but are all that while treated much after the ſame manner, as Men in this Life are.</p>
                  <p>And this will yet farther appear, if we conſider, that Satan was let looſe to tempt them. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They that are raiſed to <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> (and ſo are all they, who have in this Life heard of, and believed in the Saviour) ſhall <hi>not</hi> after their Reſurrection be <hi>tempted</hi> by him. They <hi>have fought the good Fight,</hi> they <hi>have kept the Faith,</hi> they <hi>have finiſhed their Courſe;</hi> and <hi>from thenceforth are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Crown of Glory laid up for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:49679:193"/>
                  <p n="2">2. And all thoſe, who have in this Life been made acquainted with the Saviour, and have <hi>rejected</hi> him, have by that Means put away Salvation from themſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall at their Reſurrection be raiſed to <hi>Condemnation;</hi> and ſo there will be no Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Devil to tempt them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To which we may add, That when we are told, that <hi>Satan is let looſe to tempt the Nations,</hi> it is implied, that he will tempt them from ſomething that is <hi>good,</hi> to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is <hi>evil;</hi> for, we know to what End his Temptations do drive, and that he is that <hi>roaring Lion, who goes about, ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> that is, that the Buſineſs and Deſign of his Temptations is the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Souls: And, for that Reaſon, we may alſo know, that the <hi>main</hi> Deſign of his Temptation, or Deceit, in the Text, muſt be to <hi>ſeduce</hi> the People there mentioned from <hi>believing</hi> in, and <hi>receiving</hi> the Saviour; and, by conſequence, from obtaining Salvation.</p>
                  <p>From all which we do conclude, That to qualifie theſe People for the <hi>farther</hi> Mercies of the Saviour, over and beyond the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> (which I ſhall in this Place adventure to call his <hi>general</hi> and <hi>unconditional</hi> Purchaſe) we may ſuppoſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhall be <hi>then tendred</hi> to them: For, not having heard of him in <hi>this</hi> Life, they had no Poſſibility, either of receiving or rejecting him <hi>here,</hi> as the reſt of Mankind had.</p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:49679:194"/>
                  <p n="2">2. That after they are, upon their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>made acquainted</hi> with the Saviour, they ſhall be put upon the ſame Probation, whether they will receive him upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Goſpel; as thoſe were, who had heard of him, and the Goſpel-Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in this Life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That if, upon ſuch their Probation, they do receive him; they ſhall then be in the ſame happy Condition, in which they <hi>now</hi> are, who <hi>did receive</hi> him in this Life, and who <hi>do</hi> therefore <hi>enjoy</hi> the Happineſs of the <hi>firſt</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. For, we may reaſonably judge, that if upon their Reſurrection they did <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> him, that then they ſhould die <hi>no more,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> who were <hi>alive</hi> at his firſt Coming (which Coming does ſtill continue) did <hi>not</hi> die, but were <hi>caught up</hi> to him. And perhaps for this Reaſon the Text does <hi>only</hi> account for the <hi>Death</hi> of thoſe of this Second Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, who <hi>oppoſed</hi> the Saviour, and <hi>beſieged</hi> the beloved City. And if we ſuppoſe ſuch a Proceſs in <hi>this</hi> Affair, (as indeed the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſeem to allow us more than barely to ſuppoſe it) it will upon ſuch Suppoſition be found exactly to anſwer and agree with the Proceedings at the <hi>firſt</hi> Coming of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to raiſe the Righteous. For, as then they, who believed in him, and were <hi>alive</hi> in the Earth, did <hi>not</hi> die at all, but were <hi>caught up to meet the Lord in the Air;</hi> ſo here, thoſe, who upon their Reſurrection <hi>received</hi> and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:49679:194"/>
                     <hi>believed</hi> in the Saviour then made known to them, ſhall <hi>not</hi> die, but ſhall be <hi>taken</hi> to the Lord, and ſo ſhall eſcape that <hi>Fire</hi> from Heaven, which will deſtroy all the reſt, who <hi>beſiege</hi> the beloved City: Juſt as the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at the beginning of this our Saviour's Coming were <hi>caught up to</hi> meet <hi>the Lord in the Air,</hi> and ſo <hi>eſcaped</hi> the <hi>general Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which enſued.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now, from all that has been ſaid, the Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion will be, That they, who ſhall be raiſed by that, which we have called the Second Reſurrection, are all thoſe, who never had had the Offer of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour made to them in this Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From which we may gain an eaſie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſecond Queſtion, which is, Why the Devil is let looſe to deceive them?</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of which is, Becauſe <hi>they</hi> are to undergo the <hi>ſame</hi> Probation, upon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of the Saviour to them, which <hi>thoſe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, who in this Life <hi>had</hi> the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. For, it is juſt and equitable, that they ſhould undergo the <hi>ſame</hi> Trial with thoſe of the <hi>firſt</hi> Reſurrection, for this Reaſon; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Mankind having by Sin become voluntary Subjects to Satan; it is neither agreeable to the Divine Juſtice, nor indeed to the Rules of Reaſon in general, to reſcue any of them from ſuch Subjection, <hi>without</hi> their own voluntary Conſent. For, in order to their <hi>Return</hi> to their Original Subjection
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:49679:195"/>to God, it is neceſſary, that they become <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy:</hi> And in order to their becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, it is neceſſary (and that too in the Nature of the Thing) that they be <hi>willing</hi> to become ſo. As therefore the <hi>Devil</hi> firſt brought them <hi>off from</hi> their Subjection to God, to that of himſelf, by perſuading them to <hi>conſent</hi> (that is, to be willing) to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt; ſo God brings them <hi>back again,</hi> only by perſuading them to be <hi>willing</hi> to return. For, if on one ſide or the other, either God or the Devil ſhould <hi>force</hi> or <hi>compel</hi> them to their reſpective Subjection, they could by ſuch Force neither be made <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>bad;</hi> that is, they could not become Subjects to either; becauſe there can be no moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Badneſs without the Conſent of his Will, who is good or bad. Since therefore God (having made Man a Free Agent, and ſo, capable of Moral Goodneſs) did not force them to <hi>continue good,</hi> when the Devil firſt <hi>tempted</hi> them to be <hi>bad;</hi> and ſo did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Devil from tempting them to be bad at firſt; neither will he, for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hinder the Devil from tempting them to <hi>continue</hi> ſo, no, not when he himſelf does offer to them a Saviour. So that the <hi>Offer</hi> of a Saviour by God, and his <hi>Invitations</hi> and <hi>Perſuaſions</hi> of Men to <hi>receive</hi> ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, on the <hi>one</hi> Hand; and the Devil's <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> of them <hi>from</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch Saviour on the <hi>other</hi> Hand, being
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:49679:195"/>in ſome meaſure a Counterpoiſe to each other; the Receiving or Refuſing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour becomes the Act and Deed of him, to whom he is tendred; and ſo, in Right and Juſtice, the conſequential Benefits of ſuch Receiving, and the conſequential Miſchiefs of ſuch Refuſal, ſhall become his juſt Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Tho' therefore the Devil ſhall not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to tempt thoſe of the Firſt Reſurrection any more, becauſe they had already baffled and overcome his Temptations in this Life; and ſo, notwithſtanding ſuch his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had received the Saviour on the Goſpel-Conditions: Yet becauſe the Caſe of thoſe of the Second Reſurrection is, upon ſuch their Reſurrection, and the Offer, of the Saviour then to them, juſt the <hi>ſame,</hi> as was the Caſe of the <hi>Firſt</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Life; therefore Satan ſhall be let looſe to tempt <hi>them after</hi> their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as he was to tempt the <hi>others</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Life.</p>
                  <p>God therefore, by raiſing them from the Dead, did in a Saviour <hi>do</hi> that for them, which it was utterly <hi>impoſſible</hi> for them to do for themſelves; but ſtill leaves them to do for <hi>themſelves</hi> what they <hi>can</hi> do; tho' (as we may ſuppoſe) not without ſuch Aſſiſtance as may be ſufficient (if they be not wanting to themſelves) to enable them to conquer the Devil's Temptations.</p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:49679:196"/>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third Queſtion is, Why the Devil is ſaid to be let looſe to deceive the (Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?)</p>
                  <p>In order to the Reſolution of which, we muſt take notice, that upon the Second Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, there was now Two Sorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Face of the Earth; whereof the firſt are the Inhabitants of the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the beloved City. Now, as under <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Law, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, (whoſe chief City was <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Place where God had ſetled his more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip, and his more Eſpecial Abode;) I ſay, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are oppoſed to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> that is, to the reſt of the World, in the Scriptures; ſo, in alluſion to that, (for, the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was a Type of the Church of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>) the Faithful in <hi>Chriſt</hi> are in ſeveral Places of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> called <hi>the Iſrael of God.</hi> So in the Sixth to the <hi>Galatians, ver.</hi> 16. the Apoſtle prays for <hi>Peace and Mercy</hi> upon ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>and upon the whole</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God.</hi> And when he tells us, in the Eleventh to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, ver.</hi> 26. That <hi>all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> it is evident, by the Context, that he means, all, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who ſhall <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> in the Saviour. And therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls <hi>Nathanael,</hi> in the Firſt Chapter of St. <hi>John, an</hi> Iſraelite <hi>indeed,</hi> (that is, a true good Man) <hi>in whom there is no guile.</hi> Thoſe then of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Reſurrection, in the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:49679:196"/>of <hi>Revelations,</hi> are there to be eſteemed the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, or the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But thoſe of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Reſurrection are therefore called <hi>the Nations,</hi> becauſe, upon their Reſurrection, they ſhall ſtand in ſeveral Circumſtances to thoſe of the Firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did to the <hi>Jews</hi> before, and at the firſt Promulgation of the Goſpel. For, <hi>Salvation was of the Jews;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, (and ſo our Saviour appointed) in the Thirteenth of the <hi>Acts, ver.</hi> 46. <hi>It was neceſſary, that the Word of God ſhould have firſt been ſpoken to</hi> you; <hi>but ſeeing you put it from you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>lo! we turn to the</hi> Gentiles. But ſtill the firſt Converts to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were added to the Church afterwards. Now, we muſt take notice, that the People, who are in the Eighth Verſe of the Twentieth of <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> called <hi>the Nations,</hi> who (as appears by the Context) are thoſe of the Second Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, are ſtyled in the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is tranſlated ſometimes the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Nations:</hi> The <hi>Nations,</hi> in the Verſe quoted in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Acts,</hi> quoted before. Now, from theſe Things, ſo premiſed, we take notice,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the People of this <hi>ſecond</hi> Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection are notoriouſly, in the Twentieth of <hi>Revelations,</hi> diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the <hi>firſt,</hi> much after the ſame manner, as the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:49679:197"/>
                     <hi>Gentiles</hi> in this World were from the <hi>Jews:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> being called the <hi>Nations</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> or the <hi>Holy People,</hi> the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> or the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved City.</hi> So that, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>firſt</hi> called in <hi>this</hi> World, and <hi>after</hi> them the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> who, before ſuch their Call, had no Prophecies, nor any Promiſes, concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and ſo were utter <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> to any <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him, and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, <hi>incapable</hi> of any <hi>Faith</hi> in him: So the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God are firſt <hi>raiſed</hi> in the <hi>next</hi> World, do enjoy the <hi>Promiſes</hi> in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and do <hi>inhabit</hi> what the Apoſtle calls <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which is <hi>above.</hi> And after them, <hi>thoſe</hi> who had been utter <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are <hi>raiſed,</hi> have the Saviour the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> made <hi>known</hi> to them, and ſo are put into a Capacity of entring into his <hi>Reſt,</hi> as the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God had done <hi>before</hi> them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That thoſe Nations or <hi>Gentiles</hi> were <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of being ſeduced by Satan; nay, that Multitudes of them <hi>were</hi> ſo. By which we may underſtand, (as we have obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that they were ſeduced from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was good: Nay, it is evident from the Context, that they were ſeduced to <hi>reſiſt</hi> and <hi>oppoſe</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> becauſe they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>beſiege</hi> that City, where the <hi>Saviour</hi> was <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:49679:197"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Since they were ſeduced from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was Good; and ſince it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that by ſuch their Seduction they were engaged to oppoſe the Saviour; it is (at leaſt) implied, that they were ſeduced from <hi>following</hi> him, (as his People of the <hi>firſt</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection had done, and now did) and from <hi>putting</hi> themſelves under his <hi>Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe their Multitudes are reckoned very <hi>great, ver.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. we may the rather conjecture, that they were the People, who in this Life had <hi>never</hi> heard of the Saviour, whoſe Numbers muſt needs be exceeding <hi>great.</hi> And yet,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not to be thought, that, tho' <hi>many</hi> of them were ſeduced, yet that <hi>all</hi> of them were ſo. Nay, it is more rational to think, that it will be much the ſame with them then, as it was with thoſe who had heard of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this World, where <hi>many</hi> are <hi>called,</hi> but <hi>few</hi> are <hi>choſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now this great Multitude of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reſurrection, who ſhall be ſeduced from receiving the Saviour, (tho' tendred to them) and who upon ſuch their Seduction ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him and his People, I take to be <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog:</hi> For, the Deſcription of them <hi>here,</hi> does well enough agree with that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription which we have of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in the <hi>Thirty eighth</hi> Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Let us try, by comparing them a little toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> then in the Twentieth of <hi>Revelations,</hi> are thoſe People of the Second Reſurrection, who having been ſeduced by Satan to refuſe and oppoſe the Saviour, and them who, dying in him, roſe firſt; are, for ſuch their Refuſal and Oppoſition, deſtroyed by the Vengeance of Heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:49679:199"/>
                  <p>So much for the Second Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>But before we quite leave it, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, That the Reaſons why there are not in the Scriptures any more expreſs Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a future Probation of thoſe, upon their Reſurrection, who knew nothing of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in this World, ſeem to be theſe Two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe their Reſurrection, and Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon ſuch Reſurrection, neither does, nor can concern thoſe, who <hi>have</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: For, by thoſe Scriptures <hi>they</hi> may come to the Knowledge of the Saviour in this Life, which is as much as concerns <hi>them.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Had this Reſurrection and Probation been <hi>put</hi> into the Scriptures, yet thoſe who had <hi>not</hi> thoſe Scriptures in <hi>this</hi> Life, could, for that Reaſon, have known <hi>nothing</hi> of the Matter in <hi>this</hi> Life; and ſo, as to <hi>them,</hi> as well as to the <hi>others,</hi> it had been put into the Scriptures in <hi>vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet, when the Account which the Scriptures give us of God's Dealing with Mankind, draws towards a <hi>Concluſion;</hi> that is, when it comes to that Period, where their Caſe <hi>ends,</hi> who have in this Life <hi>had</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of a Saviour, and where their Caſe <hi>begins,</hi> who ſhall have ſuch Revelation <hi>after</hi> their Reſurrection: I ſay, when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do come to that Point, they do by the Account that they then give us of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, of the City of the Saints, of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, &amp;c.</hi> compared with ſome
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:49679:200"/>other Texts, give us ſome duskie Glimpſes of ſuch an Oeconomy and Proceeding.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third and Laſt Reſurrection is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in the Eleventh and following Verſes, to the end of the Chapter: In which we have an Account of the Laſt Judgment, by the Deſcription of the great White Throne, and him that ſat upon it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection I take to be only the Reſurrection of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and of all others, who had <hi>refuſed</hi> the Saviour in this Life, as <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> did after their Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For, firſt, The Faithful (in this Life) were raiſed, in the Fourth Verſe, and died <hi>no more. All</hi> then that were raiſed at the <hi>firſt</hi> Reſurrection, I take to be <hi>one Part</hi> of thoſe, who were written in the Book of <hi>Life.</hi> For, tho' the Deſcription of thoſe raiſed in the Fourth Verſe, may not ſeem, and is not thought by ſome to extend to <hi>all</hi> the Faithful in this Life, but only to <hi>Martyrs:</hi> Yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſeveral other Texts do aſſure us, that <hi>the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe</hi> firſt; therefore, by the warrant of <hi>thoſe</hi> Texts, in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Fourth</hi> Verſe, I do extend the firſt Reſurrection to <hi>all</hi> who believed in <hi>this World.</hi> Beſides, They who did <hi>not</hi> receive the Mark of the Beaſt, nor of his Image, in the Fourth Verſe, and they that <hi>did;</hi> I ſay, this Diviſion does include all Believers and Unbelievers in <hi>this</hi> World: And it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that ſo it does through the whole Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:49679:200"/>that this Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> gives us of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> and of thoſe who <hi>refuſed</hi> the Mark of the Beaſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And we have already ſurmiſed, That ſome of <hi>thoſe</hi> who are raiſed by the Second Reſurrection, ſhall <hi>believe</hi> and be <hi>ſaved,</hi> and that too <hi>before</hi> the great White Throne is ſet. And indeed it is not to be thought, that the Saviour ſhould be made <hi>known</hi> to them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>ſome</hi> of them were to have <hi>received,</hi> and <hi>believed</hi> in him. And therefore I do entirely <hi>exclude both</hi> theſe Sorts of <hi>Believers;</hi> that is, in other Words, I do exclude <hi>all,</hi> who ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> out of this Third and <hi>laſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he who ſhall well weigh and conſider the Account that is given of the Great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mentioned in the Eleventh and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes, will (I believe) be ſatisfied, that it is only the Judgment paſſed upon <hi>Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> For, as the <hi>Books,</hi> that were <hi>opened,</hi> are mentioned as diſtinct from the Book of <hi>Life;</hi> ſo it is expreſly ſaid, that they were judged out of the <hi>Books.</hi> If therefore the Book of Life did contain in it <hi>all</hi> that were <hi>ſaved,</hi> as moſt notoriouſly ſo it did; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Import of the <hi>Phraſe,</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> tells us, that <hi>whoſoever was</hi> not <hi>found written in the Book of</hi> Life, <hi>was caſt into the</hi> Lake <hi>of Fire, ver.</hi> 15. Then thoſe who were judged out of the <hi>Books,</hi> diſtinct from the Book of <hi>Life,</hi> can only be the <hi>Unbelievers</hi> and the <hi>Reprobate.</hi>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:49679:201"/>The <hi>third</hi> and <hi>laſt Reſurrection</hi> therefore does only belong to <hi>ſuch.</hi> From which I would remark, That God is ſlow in the Execution, as of <hi>other</hi> his Judgments; ſo more notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in this his <hi>laſt</hi> and heavy Judgment; becauſe we find, that he has aſſigned the very <hi>laſt</hi> Place to <hi>this,</hi> among all his Dealings with the Children of Men.</p>
